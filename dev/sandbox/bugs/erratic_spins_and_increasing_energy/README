When running a ringdown of a domain wall in a nanowire with
notches I noticed some weird behaviour with an isolated spin
that started flipping erratically after some time. Also, at
the same time both the exchange and the total energy increase
dramatically. We managed to track down the timestep at which
this seems to begin to happen (after ca. 4.4 ns). The file
m_000088.npy is a snapshot of the magnetisation at that time
(it was saved every 0.05 ns). Thogether with the mesh this
should be enough to recreate the simulation and continue it
running from there.
