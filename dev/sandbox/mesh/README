The ./mshr_demag_test.py and ./netgen_demag_test.py files
generate a large mesh with mshr and netgen respectively.
The mesh is a hollow long cylinder, which is used in a small
finmag simulation that has only Demag energy.
 In the Osiris
machine, the test fails for the mshr example, for any length of
the mesh. For the netgen example, the memory blows up when
using a length larger than L~1150 approximately, although for 
L=1000, the memory usage is quite low, which is strange.
