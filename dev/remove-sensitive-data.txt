Steps to remove sensitive data from the repository:

1. Make sure to have a fresh clone of the repository.

2. In the top level of the repository, run:

    git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
    'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path-to-file-with-sensitive-data' \
    --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

3. Double check everything was removed.

4. Push the changes (all branches)

    git push origin --force --all

5. Push the changes (all tags and releases)

    git push origin --force --tags

6. If anybody with a local copy of repository pushes again, everything will be messed up. Everbody must make sure they start working in a freshly cloned repository (or rebase the existing one).
