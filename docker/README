This docker file is for testing finmag with Ubuntu 16.04.  It makes an
image containing finmag's dependencies, and then mounts the finmag
source directory.

The expectation is to run the following command from the directory
that this file is in:

If you have changed the docker file and need to update container, use: 

    make build

If you want to push the new container to hub.docker, run:

    make push

In most cases, to just use the container, use

    make run
    # this may take some time and will take you inside the docker container


    # the next three lines are only required the first time we use this. 
    cd src/finmag
    make
    cd ../..

    # Letâ€™s try the tests:
    make tests

Note that because the host system file directory is mounted into the
container, we are operating on all the finmag (source) files that are
on the host (and not on the file system of the container).
