Eclipse
=======

Install Eclipse
----------------

Method 1. Install from ubuntu repositories.
    Installs version 3.8.
    sudo apt-get install eclipse

Method 2. Download from eclipse website.
    Installs version 4.3.
    You'll need the Java environment OpenJDK so
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre
    Note that GNU-Java (gcr-jre) won't work.

    Then download eclipse from 
    https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Alternative if you prefer to pay money:
    Install LiClipse instead of eclipse from
    http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse
    which has python support built-in

Install Python Support
----------------------

Click Help -> Install New Software... -> Add...
Enter PyDev as name and http://pydev.org/updates as Location.
Then check the box named "PyDev" and click Next.
Finish the installation.

Add finmag project
------------------

Add a new PyDev project
    File -> New -> Project -> PyDev -> PyDev Project
Don't use the default project contents but select your finmag directory.
Set don't configure PYTHONPATH (you will probably have done that already).


First Steps
-----------

I like adding an Outline window, which will list variables and functions
in the opened file. Add it by clicking Window -> Show View -> Outline.

Jump to Definition is F3.

Troubleshooting
---------------

I'm running eclipse 4.3.1. and the menus don't show!
