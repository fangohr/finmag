As of 14 Nov 2012, the following actions had to be taken on osiris to allow the  Ubuntu 12.04 system to convert the ipython notebooks into sphinx documentation:

install python-markdown, git, pandoc, tornado (aptitude install python-markdown git pandoc python-tornado)
install latest ipython (pip install -U ipython)
pip install -U docutils


The last point was hard to understand as nbconvert would fail to execute conversion correctly (complaining about a file access error) but not mention that this relates to a missing 'pandoc' installation on the system.

We also need to install (Max' improved version of) nbconvert with these steps:

  cd /usr/local/src #or other directory you desire
  git clone git://github.com/maxalbert/nbconvert.git

Then switch to custom branch:

  git checkout add_output_dest_argument

... and set the NBCONVERT environment variable (in doc/Makefile) to point to the file "nbconvert.py".



At some point, we should wrap this up in a script to run automatially to install the dependencies. On the other hand, 

Done together with Max.
