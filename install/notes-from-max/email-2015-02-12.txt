Update (mostly for Hans, since David and I just did this):

- Clone Finmag and compile it:

     hg clone https://cilix@bitbucket.org/fangohr/finmag

After cloning Finmag, you first need to check out the branch "iridis_compilation", otherwise the compilation will fail

   hg update iridis_compilation

Then proceed as in my previous email and it should work.

Cheers,
Max
