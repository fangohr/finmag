To create the docker container, we need a finmag.deb file in this directory.

Then run 'sudo sh build-docker-image.sh'

Next steps:

- provide license file 
- understand where the container is stored
- how we can port the container to a different machine (Iridis eventually)
- how can we run the docker contain without sudo rights (on iridis, say)
- can we (and should we) not run simulations as root inside the container

We also need an example to run a simulation script stored in the local
directory inside the container. Should be straightforward, but would
be good to add this here somewhere.
