# color_scheme choices: [dark_bg, light_bg, none]
color_scheme = dark_bg

# Logfiles entries:
# -Files with an absolute path name (such as '~/.finmag/global.log') 
#  define global logfiles to which all finmag programs will add
#  log statements.
#  
# -Filenames without an absolute path (such as 'session.log') result in
#  a logfile of that name being created in the current working
#  directory when 'import finmag' is loading the finmag module.
#
#  For example
#logfiles =
#   ~/.finmag/global.log
#   session.log

logfiles =
    ~/.finmag/global.log

# logging level choices: [DEBUG, INFO, WARNING]
