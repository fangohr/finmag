Started to put together a script to put together 'generic'
documentation for finmag. We can use this (emacs orgmode) document 
to track completion of this.

The idea is to bundle those (ipython notebook) docs that explain the
basic use that is likely to be relevant to all finmag users.

This might include DMI, dispersion relation calculations and normal
mode computations as this is a somewhat specialised application.

It should include basic capabilities to

- [ ] set up a micromagnetic problem
- [ ] with and without anisotropy
- [ ] with and without applied field
- [ ] save data
  - [ ] averages
  - [ ] fields
  this would be natural place to explain the whole 'schedule' capabilities

- [ ] restart from a saved configuration
- [ ] sampling data at arbitrary positions 
- [ ] plotting (or saving vtk files) of configurations 
- [ ] and saving vtk files of animated sequences.
