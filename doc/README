# README on generating documentation for Finmag.
# Written by Anders E. Johansen 23/2/2012

To view documentation:
----------------------

1. Navigate to /finmag/doc/
2. $ python generate_doc.py
3. $ make html
4. $ firefox _build/html/index.html


Writing documentation:
----------------------

We are using Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) to generate documentation. Basic use includes simple inline markup, using mathematics in LaTeX syntax, and code snippets.

See for example http://fenicsproject.org/contributing/styleguide_doc.html#styleguide-documentation for more information on this.

When you have documented your code, and want to add it to the html files, please do as follows:

i)    Open /finmag/doc/modules.txt
ii)   Add to the list of modules a line containing the name you want in the webpage header (this can be several words separated by spaces) and the path to the module (this must NOT include spaces or /).
iii)  Repeat steps 1-4 above.


Important:
----------

When documenting a class structure, Sphinx does not include docstrings from __init__, so please put these in the first line in the class instead. I.e. do

class Foo:
    """
    Docstring is here.
    """

    def __init__(self, *args):


instead of

class Bar:
    def __init__(self, *args):
        """
        Docstring should not be here.
        """

The author of this README has not yet figured out how to get syntax highlighting on the code snippets without adding >>> in front of every line, so please continue with this until further notice. If someone knows how to do this, please tell me.
