* ref-using-timings.ipynb

- <2014-01-10 Fri> Almost all output in this notebook was timing related so it was flagged with "IPYTHON_TEST_IGNORE_OUTPUT". Is there a test we can do with the timings module that would be consistent for testing across machines? -- Mark V.


* tutorial-NormalModeSimulation

- <2013-11-06 Wed> error in cell [10] (calling sim.plot_spectrum)


* Is tutorial-normal-modes.ipynb obsolete

- <2013-11-06 Wed> it doesn't execute, and
  tutorial-NormalModeSimulation looks nicer and includes the ringdown?


* tutorial-sampling-m-at-arbitrary-positions.ipynb

- <2013-04-12 Wed> Inconsistent m values between runs, past 4d.p.

* tutorial-normal-modes.ipynb

- [2014-01-16 Thu] This notebook passes the test, but it uses a very
  low-level approach and a lot of the functionality has been wrapped
  up in convenience function. It would be good to merge this with the
  other normal mode tutorials (or even remove it?). -- Max

* ref-using-timings.ipynb

- [2014-01-16 Thu] Execution of the NEB-computing function fails. This
  needs reviewing in the NEB code (-> Weiwei). -- Max

* tutorial_mesh_templates.ipynb

- [2014-01-16 Thu] The functionality in this notebook is probably
  obsolete because dolfin already has a CSG module. We should turn
  this notebook into a tutorial about that dolfin module. -- Max

* dev-restricting-a-dolfin-function-to-a-submesh.ipynb

- [2014-01-16 Thu] This notebook requires dolfin > 1.2.0, but we are
  still running version 1.2 on Jenkins. Thus this will only pass the
  test once we have upgraded dolfin to version 1.3 on aleph0.

* ref-domain-wall-energy-class.ipynb

- [2014-01-16 Thu] The computation with the FixedEnergyDW class is broken.
  Also, a purpose needs to be added in the summary section (--> Weiwei).
