* ref-using-timings.ipynb

- <2014-01-10 Fri> Almost all output in this notebook was timing related so it was flagged with "IPYTHON_TEST_IGNORE_OUTPUT". Is there a test we can do with the timings module that would be consistent for testing across machines? -- Mark V.


* tutorial-NormalModeSimulation

- <2013-11-06 Wed> error in cell [10] (calling sim.plot_spectrum)


* Is tutorial-normal-modes.ipynb obsolete

- <2013-11-06 Wed> it doesn't execute, and
  tutorial-NormalModeSimulation looks nicer and includes the ringdown?


* tutorial-sampling-m-at-arbitrary-positions.ipynb

- <2013-04-12 Wed> Inconsistent m values between runs, past 4d.p.
