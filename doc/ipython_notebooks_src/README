This directory contains sample .ipynb files which will automatically
be converted to .rst format and included in the documentation when it
is built.

New .ipynb files can be added in two ways:

  (i) By manually committing them.

 (ii) By steering a browser to https://summer.kk.soton.ac.uk:9999/ and
      creating a new notebook there interactively. Notebooks created
      in this way will be automatically commited by a cronjob once per
      day.

Option (ii) is not operational yet.
