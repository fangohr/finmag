"""
This module contains convenience functions to create common types of
meshes. The execution time may be relatively slow (in particular for
fine meshes) because the mesh creation is done externally via Netgen.

Caveat: Netgen only saves the first 5-6 digits (or so) of each
coordinate during the mesh creation process. Thus it is not advisable
to use these functions to create meshes on the nanoscale. Instead,
create a "macroscopic" mesh and use something like unit_length=1e-9 to
set the desired length scale when reading the mesh into Finmag!

    Using netgen, returns a dolfin mesh object built from the given geofile.

    *Arguments*
        geofile (str)
            Filename of a .geo file which is compatible with netgen.
        save_result (bool) [optional]
            Controls whether the resulting dolfin mesh is saved to
            disk (default: True). Doing so greatly speeds up later
            calls to the function with the same geofile. If the

    Plot the given mesh.

    Note that for fine meshes it may be necessary to adjust the
    `linewidth` argument because if the mesh edges are drawn too thick
    compared to the entire mesh then the figure will appear all black.

    FIXME: For 2D meshes we currently draw a wireframe mesh by default
    because I haven't figured out yet how to use `tripcolor` properly.
    This should be changed so that 2D and 3D plotting are consistent.
    Also, once this is done it might be nice to provide a `wireframe`
    keyword which enables/disables wireframe-style plotting.

    TODO: It might be nice to automatically adjust the linewidth, e.g.
          based on the ratio mesh.num_cells()/mesh_volume(mesh).

    *Arguments*

    ax : None or matplotlib.axes.AxesSubplot (for 2D meshes)
              or matplotlib.axes.Axes3DSubplot (for 3D meshes)

        If `ax` is not given, an appropriate Axes object is created
        automatically. Note that a 3D Axes object can be created as
        follows:

           import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    The 'color' argument as well as all other keyword arguments are
    passed on to matplotlib's `plot_trisurf` (for 3D meshes) or to
    `triplot` (for 2D meshes).

    *Returns*

    provided by the user or the one which was automatically created).

    *Arguments*

    fun_mesh_regions : dolfin.CellFunction

        A dolfin.MeshFunction defined on the cells of the mesh. It
        should take integer values which indicate for each cell which
        mesh region it belongs to.

    regions : int or list of ints

        The region(s) to plot.

    colors : single color or list of colors

        Colors to be used for the markers of the individual regions.
        If the number of supplied colors is shorter than the number of
        regions, colors from the beginning of the list will be reused.

    alphas : float or list of floats

        Alpha (= transparency) values to be used for the markers of
        the individual regions. If the number of supplied alpha values
        is shorter than the number of regions to be plotted, values
        from the beginning of the list will be reused.

        Markers to be used for the markers of the individual regions.
        If the number of supplied markers is shorter than the number
        of regions to be plotted, values from the beginning of the
        list will be reused.

    marker_sizes : float or list of float

        Sizes for the markers of the individual regions.
        If the number of supplied markers is shorter than the number
        of regions to be plotted, values from the beginning of the
        list will be reused.

    zoom_to_mesh_size : boolean

        If this is True then the x-, y- and z-axis limits are
        automatically adjusted to the minimum/maximum x-coordinate of
        the mesh so that the visible region covers the extent of the
        mesh. Note that if not all mesh regions are plotted, this
        means that parts of the plot will appear to be empty.

        The reason for this behaviour is that it can be quite
        confusing if a region appears to fill the entire screen (due
        to matplotlib automatically adjusting the axis limits) when it
        is only supposed to cover a small part of the mesh. If this is
        behaviour is undesired, set `zoom_to_mesh_size` to False. If
        necessary, you can also explicitly call 'ax.set_xlim3d()' (and
        similarly for y and z limits) on the Axis object which is
        returned from this function.

    ax : None or matplotlib.axes.Axes3DSubplot

        If `ax` is not given, an appropriate Axes object is created
