    """
    Set the applied field to the first value in `H_ext_list` (which should
    be a list of external field vectors) and then call the relax() method.
    When convergence is reached, the field is changed to the next one in
    H_ext_list, and so on until all values in H_ext_list are exhausted.

    Note: The fields in H_ext_list are applied *in addition to* any Zeeman
          interactions that are already present in the simulation.
          In particular, if only one external field should be present then
          do not add any Zeeman interactions before calling this method.

    *Arguments*

        H_ext_list -- list of external fields, where each field can have
                      any of the forms accepted by Zeeman.__init__()
                      (see its docstring for more details)

       leave_last_field_on -- if False (the default) then the external
                              field is switched off again after all
                              relaxations are finished.

       fun -- the user can pass a function here (which should accept the
              Simulation object as its only argument); this function is
              called after each relaxation and can be used for example to
              save the value of the averaged magnetisation.

    If `fun` is not None then this function returns a list containing
    an accumulation of all the return values of `fun` after each stage.
    Otherwise this function returns None.

    For a list of keyword arguments accepted by this method see the
    documentation of the relax() method, to which all given keyword
    arguments are passed on. Note that if a `filename` argument is
    provided, the string 'stage_xxx' is appended to it, where xxx is
    a running counter which indicates for which field in H_ext_list
    the relax() method is being executed.
