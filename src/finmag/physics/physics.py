        Computes the Jacobian-times-vector product, as used by sundials cvode.

        The time integration problem we need to solve is of type

        .. math::

                 \\frac{d y}{d t} = f(y,t)

        where y is the state vector (such as the magnetisation components for
        all sites), t is the time, and f(y,t) is the LLG equation.

        For the implicite integration schemes, sundials' cvode solver
        needs to know the Jacobian J, which is the derivative of the
        (vector-valued) function f(y,t) with respect to the (components
        of the vector) y. The Jacobian is a matrix.

        For a magnetic system N sites, the state vector y has 3N entries
        (because every site has 3 components). The Jacobian matrix J would
        thus have a size of 3N*3N. In general, this is too big to store.

        Fortunately, cvode only needs the result of the multiplication of some
        vector y' (provided by cvode) with the Jacobian. We can thus store
        the Jacobian in our own way (in particular as a sparse matrix
        if we leave out the demag field), and carry out the multiplication of
        J with y' when required, and that is what this function does.

        In more detail: We use the variable name mp to represent m' (i.e. mprime) which
        is just a notation to distinguish m' from m (and not any derivative).

        Our equation is:

        .. math::

             \\frac{dm}{dt} = LLG(m, H)

        And we're interested in computing the Jacobian (J) times vector (m') product

        .. math::

             J m' = [\\frac{dLLG(m, H)}{dm}] m'.

        However, the H field itself depends on m, so the total derivative J m'
        will have two terms

        .. math::

             \\frac{d LLG(m, H)}{dm} = \\frac{\\partial LLG(m, H)}{\\partial m} + [\\frac{\\partial LLG(m, H)}{\\partial H}] [\\frac{\\partial H(m)}{\\partial m}].


        This is a matrix identity, so to make the derivations easier (and since we don't need the full Jacobian matrix) we can write the Jacobian-times-vector product as a directional derivative:

        .. math::

             J m' = \\frac{d LLG(m + a m',H(m + a m'))}{d a}|_{a=0}


        The code to compute this derivative is in ``llg.cc`` but you can see that the derivative will depend
        on m, m', H(m), and dH(m+a m')/da [which is labelled H' in the code].

        Most of the components of the effective field are linear in m; if that's the case,
        the directional derivative H' is just H(m')

        .. math::

             H' = \\frac{d H(m+a m')}{da} = H(m')
