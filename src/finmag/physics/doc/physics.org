Re-organising finmag by creating a physics submodule.

It needs to be able to answer the following type of
questions. Given a magnetisation, time and primary
fields like current density and Zeeman:

- what is dm/dt? (this will be used by the time integrator)
- what is the total energy o1f the system?
- what is the exchange field?
  
* Tasks

Note: A task is not completed until the tests run.

** DONE move the llg.py file to physics
   CLOSED: [2014-05-15 Thu 17:56]
** DONE move the sllg.py file to physics
   CLOSED: [2014-05-15 Thu 18:30]
** DONE move neb.py to physics
   CLOSED: [2014-05-15 Thu 18:37]
** DONE move the llb directory to physics
   CLOSED: [2014-05-15 Thu 20:11]
** TODO move the effective_field.py file to physics
** TODO create physics.py file
** TODO hook up effective field computation to the physics.py
** TODO hook up the LLG equation to the physics.py
	Make sure communication to outside goes through
	Physics class. There needs to be infrastructure
	in place to chose the equation.
** TODO create dm/dt in Physics, how does an equation
	connect to it?
** TODO make slonczewski accessible through Physics class
** TODO integrate sllg.py
	so it plays nice with Physics
** TODO integrate llb so it fits into 
   llb has its own version of all energies because
   it operates on M and wants to change the magnitude of M
