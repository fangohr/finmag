fangohr: Still testing ...
2012-02-12 21:32:46 fangohr: And more testing.
2012-02-12 21:33:40 fangohr: Working on logging this session automatically.
2012-02-12 21:42:44 fangohr: If all goes well, then this note will be auto-committed tonight to the mercurial repository.
2012-02-13 09:19:35 HansFangohr: Morning everybody.
2012-02-13 11:24:25 ww1g11: Hello, this is Weiwei.
2012-02-13 11:24:52 HansFangohr: Yuuhouu, well done Weiwei :)
2012-02-13 12:06:41 HansFangohr: Anybody up for lunch? When? 12:30? 13:00?
2012-02-13 12:46:53 mb8g11: 13:00 is good.
2012-02-13 12:54:14 HansFangohr: Okay, let's make it so.
2012-02-13 12:54:55 andersej: I'll join!
2012-02-13 16:31:45 mb8g11: How can I make sure if I work on a matrix or a vector?
2012-02-13 17:14:43 HansFangohr: If I understand the question correctly, and this is about numpy.arrays, you can use the 'shape' attribute of an array to distingish them.
2012-02-14 09:44:31 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-02-14 09:46:43 HansFangohr: Good morning, Sir :)
2012-02-14 09:54:58 HansFangohr: Hi Anders, I played a little with your code, and added a comment to the story in pivotal -- not sure whether you get email notification for this?
2012-02-14 09:56:31 HansFangohr: Marc-Antonio (mb8g11), as you rightly say, we should make the 'stories' as small as possible. I have thus accepted the 'exchange' story as completed, and added two new ones, each suggesting a test for the exchange interaction. Feel free to add more as you go along.
2012-02-14 09:56:49 HansFangohr: I am busy all morning with Interviews of new PhD students; I hope to have some time in the early afternoon.
2012-02-14 10:00:25 andersej: Yes, I got the notification. Will take a closer look at it. If it is zero initially, it will always be zero in this simple case. Perhaps it changes if there are other contributions to the equation.
2012-02-14 11:44:19 GabrielB: Hi everyone can anyone advise me with mercurial? I have added a "documentation" subdirectory to /demag and am not quite sure how to get HG to see it and push it up into Bitbucket.
2012-02-14 11:52:46 andersej: Think it is just hg add file, hg commit -m 'Message of what is changed', and then hg push.
2012-02-14 11:53:26 andersej: Where file of course is the name of the file you want to add.
2012-02-14 11:58:29 mb8g11: Are there files in that directory?
2012-02-14 12:39:52 andersej: Anyone up for lunch sometime between now and 1?
2012-02-14 12:42:19 mb8g11: 13:00 is good.
2012-02-14 12:51:55 GabrielB: thanks Anders! I will try with -m instead of the normal commit.
2012-02-14 12:52:51 GabrielB: I have just spoken to Anders Logg, he  recommended Nitsche's method in order to get the demag field.
2012-02-14 13:49:50 HansFangohr: Hi Gabriel, that's great. What is Nitsche's method ? ;-) Do you have a reference for it? I haven't heard of the name yet.
2012-02-14 13:54:50 mb8g11:  1ffd48ebd533b81339e58e1f185c32a8ebeedce8
2012-02-14 13:55:01 mb8g11: J.A. Nitsche, Uber ein Variationsprinzip zur Loesung von Dirichlet-Problemen bei Verwendung von Teilraeumen, die keinen Randbedingungen unterworfen sind, Abhandlungen aus
2012-02-14 13:55:04 mb8g11: dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universitaet Hamburg 36 (1970/71), 9â€“15. MR0341903(49:6649)
2012-02-14 13:55:17 mb8g11: disregard the first message, that was a paste gone wrong
2012-02-14 13:58:32 mb8g11: @GabrielB it is not possible to represent an empty directory in Mercurial. As soon as you put a file in it though, you can simply commit the file and the repository will get added as well.
2012-02-14 13:58:46 mb8g11: *and the directory
2012-02-14 14:00:09 GabrielB: When I commited I think my file was stored locally and not as part of the project attached to the Bitbucket depo.
2012-02-14 14:02:37 GabrielB: my folder "documentation" does not show up in the source when I look at it in bitbucket
2012-02-14 14:03:57 mb8g11: Let's say you have the file doc.tex in there.
2012-02-14 14:04:07 mb8g11: hg add documentation/doc.tex
2012-02-14 14:04:17 mb8g11: hg ci (or hg ci documentation/doc.tex)
2012-02-14 14:04:30 mb8g11: hg push
2012-02-14 14:06:38 GabrielB: thanks this is what i get
2012-02-14 14:06:40 GabrielB: gaba@ubuntu:~/devmag/finmag/devtests/demag/documentation$ hg add truncdemag1.tex
2012-02-14 14:06:40 GabrielB: truncdemag1.tex already tracked!
2012-02-14 14:06:41 GabrielB: gaba@ubuntu:~/devmag/finmag/devtests/demag/documentation$ hg ci
2012-02-14 14:06:41 GabrielB: nothing changed
2012-02-14 14:06:41 GabrielB: gaba@ubuntu:~/devmag/finmag/devtests/demag/documentation$ hg push
2012-02-14 14:06:41 GabrielB: pushing to default-push
2012-02-14 14:06:43 GabrielB: abort: repository default-push not found!
2012-02-14 14:08:37 GabrielB: This description of the method is the closest to what was shown to me by Anders.
2012-02-14 14:08:38 GabrielB: www.ann.jussieu.fr/2007/PDFSeminaires/RolfStenberg071207.pdf
2012-02-14 14:08:57 GabrielB: If it works I will include it in the Docu of course :-)
2012-02-14 14:10:51 mb8g11: In the repository root, open the file .hg/hgrc. You want it to look like that http://www.pastebucket.com/1484
2012-02-14 14:11:09 mb8g11: I assumed you use https and not ssh.
2012-02-14 14:20:15 mb8g11: If all fails, check out a new copy of the repo and copy the files by hand. And while you're at it, set up SSH, there is a nice guide in the bitbucket documentation.
2012-02-14 14:20:31 mb8g11: That way, you won't have to enter your password when pushing.
2012-02-14 14:28:52 GabrielB: ok the repository root already has the pastebucket code. I am guessing I shouldnt try adding it to .hg/hgrc in the new directory
2012-02-14 14:29:10 mb8g11: Correct.
2012-02-14 14:31:05 mb8g11: Try hg push https://gabrielb@bitbucket.org/fangohr/finmag
2012-02-14 14:55:54 GabrielB: implemented a 1-d Nitsche method. The results seem to look similar to that obtained by Fredkin- Koehler.
2012-02-14 14:57:55 GabrielB: the results can be seem in nitschetest.py
2012-02-14 14:59:07 GabrielB: I moved the documentation out of the new folder for now thanks for the help so far mb8g11 (Mark I guess!), I will keep trying later to get the new folder in place and clean up a bit
2012-02-14 14:59:49 Marc-Antonio: Yes, Marc
2012-02-14 15:04:52 GabrielB: lol I am off to pick up my daughter! see everyone tomorrow
2012-02-14 15:18:21 andersej: @Marc-Antonio, can you take a look at my program when you have time?
2012-02-14 15:20:58 Marc-Antonio: 16:00?
2012-02-14 15:21:10 andersej: Great
2012-02-14 15:30:12 HansFangohr: Hi all, what is a good IRC client for Linux (Ubuntu)?
2012-02-14 15:31:51 andersej: I'm happy with xchat now.
2012-02-15 08:54:57 HansFangohr: Morning Anders.
2012-02-15 08:56:00 andersej: Good morning! Just read your email, I'll have it done by the end of the day.
2012-02-15 08:58:21 HansFangohr: No rush -- it may just be fun to do this :) I also had another idea for a good test, and will add this to the tracker in a moment.
2012-02-15 09:01:26 HansFangohr: This is the extra test for the Jacobian: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/24971625
2012-02-15 09:04:33 HansFangohr: Anders, I added a story for the test I suggested in the email: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/24971705
2012-02-15 09:06:26 andersej: Okay, i thought you combined it in the first one. Sorry. I don't mean to steal all stories.
2012-02-15 09:16:32 HansFangohr: You steal as many as you like :)
2012-02-15 09:40:22 HansFangohr: Hi Gabriel.
2012-02-15 09:40:45 HansFangohr: Andersej, just to add; I think the reason I didn't see those stories started is that you didn't click on 'save' yet or so -- It is all here now.
2012-02-15 11:19:47 andersej: HansFangohr, do you have time today to explain the two time scales scheme a bit more detailed than in the story description?
2012-02-15 11:48:56 HansFangohr: Not at the moment (but later this afternoon). You don't need to worry about it: Use an exchange interaction strength that is realistic (ask MA, or the Nmag Manual) and an applied field that has the strength of 1 Tesla (that is very roughly 1e6 A/m, the same magnitude as the saturation magnetisation), and you should have the two timescales. I think Marc-Antonio maybe able to explain as well.
2012-02-15 14:36:00 HansFangohr: Andersej, are you okay to come to my office to talk through your code?
2012-02-15 14:36:46 andersej: Yes, I'm there in two minutes. Will just push what I'm doing.
2012-02-15 14:37:47 HansFangohr: Okay, great.
2012-02-15 14:50:25 mb8g11: Hans, I'm afraid that the loading of the C-code works perfectly fine on my machine.
2012-02-15 15:08:22 HansFangohr: Marc-Antonio, I have created an account for you on the machine. It is called 'osiris.sesnet.soton.ac.uk'.
2012-02-15 15:10:00 mb8g11: (by the way, the volume is a vector)
2012-02-16 09:28:37 HansFangohr: Greetings, DokosBot.
2012-02-16 10:31:42 HansFangohr: Hi Andersej, mb8g11, any plans for lunch? If so, what is your preferred time?
2012-02-16 10:32:22 andersej: 12:30?
2012-02-16 10:37:00 HansFangohr: Okay, fine. Dmitri and I have a meeting at 11;00 in physics. We'll come back to the office before lunch then -- probably takes only 30 or 45 minutes.
2012-02-16 10:56:59 mb8g11: Oki.
2012-02-17 09:23:07 HansFangohr: Morning Anders and DokosBot.
2012-02-17 09:23:40 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-02-17 13:18:15 andersej: Which PETSc version are you using? I'm on 3.2-p5 and I get PETSc error when I try to run /examples/exchange_1D/run_visual.py. It is caused by the last line of the first for loop (line 52).
2012-02-20 08:55:38 HansFangohr: Morning DokosBot.
2012-02-20 09:11:44 mb8g11: Good morning!
2012-02-20 09:12:23 HansFangohr: Good Morning. I am just moving the (very handy) DokosBot from eta to summer.kk - a good opportunity to document this here.
2012-02-20 09:28:57 mb8g11: So is summer the newly installed machine?
2012-02-20 09:29:31 HansFangohr: Yes; the machine was around before but I had to upgrade the OS somewhat severly (done now).
2012-02-20 09:34:52 HansFangohr: Hello DokosBot. You have just joined automatically (via a cronjob) because summer.kk rebooted. You are started via fangohr's cronjob, and another cronjob on the same machine will commit all the changes to finmag/logbooks/finmag-irc.log every night at 23:59. Just so we have this recorded.
2012-02-20 10:54:09 mb8g11: Do you know how to disable the demag-field in nmag or point me to the documentation? Can't find how to do so.
2012-02-20 10:54:47 fangohr: Yes, when you create a simulation object, there should be an option like 'demag=False' or so.
2012-02-20 10:55:39 fangohr: Actually, it is 'do_demag=False'. See http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/nmag/0.2/manual/html/command_reference.html#simulation
2012-02-20 10:57:37 mb8g11: thank you!
2012-02-20 14:38:45 GabrielB: 2-d and 3-d demag problems implemented! Tests for solver coming soon.
2012-02-20 15:15:50 HansFangohr: Hi Gabriel, great. I'll try to have a look at this soon.
2012-02-21 08:46:18 andersej: Good morning, Hans and DokosBot!
2012-02-21 09:06:18 HansFangohr: Good Morning Anders and DokosBot.
2012-02-21 09:09:47 HansFangohr: Anders, shall we get together in 20 minutes or so to go through Marie's reply?2012-02-21 09:50:49 andersej: Again I don't get notifications when I get a message... Sorry. But is it okay now? I can come to your office.
2012-02-21 12:03:13 HansFangohr: Hi Anders, am on the phone right now. Lunch in 20 minutes or so?
2012-02-21 12:20:24 andersej: Yes.
2012-02-21 12:27:36 HansFangohr: Fab, I'll come over now.
2012-02-22 08:44:18 HansFangohr: Morning Anders, DokosBot.
2012-02-22 09:03:23 HansFangohr: Hi Gabriel, good to see you.
2012-02-22 09:03:43 HansFangohr: Are you okay to delay our meeting today to 15:30 UK time? Not sure whether you have seen my email already.
2012-02-22 09:04:27 GabrielB: Hi hans I'll read the mail
2012-02-22 09:06:31 GabrielB: Ahh ok Doctoral training centre meeting alles klar. 15: 30 might be pushing it a little do you have any time this morning?
2012-02-22 09:07:39 GabrielB: Ahh I mean it might be bit late and the it would be nicer to meet in the morning with less time pressure :-)
2012-02-22 09:07:40 HansFangohr: No, teaching. How about tomorrow 10am?
2012-02-22 09:07:51 HansFangohr: Yes, I agree ;-)
2012-02-22 09:08:25 HansFangohr: By what time do you need to leave? Maybe we can start today, and continue tomorrow?
2012-02-22 09:08:47 GabrielB: ok sounds good! Just to give you a quick update the Nitsche Solver passes all the tests so far now that the boundary values of phitot have been fixed.
2012-02-22 09:09:18 GabrielB: So for tomorrow I will try to compare to the analytic solution and of course write up a summary of the nitsche method
2012-02-22 09:09:24 HansFangohr: That sounds great. Also in 3d? ;-)
2012-02-22 09:09:27 GabrielB: yes
2012-02-22 09:09:34 GabrielB: 1 to 3 d :-)
2012-02-22 09:09:49 HansFangohr: Fabulous.
2012-02-22 09:10:58 HansFangohr: If you choose M=[1,0,0], you should fine that phi is a linear function of x inside the sphere. In particular, if you compute the negative gradient of phi, you should get a vector field that is [-1/3,0,0] inside the sphere. I guess this is the analytic solution you refer to, and would be nice to see.
2012-02-22 09:32:30 andersej: Sorry, didn't get notified as usual.. Morning! How come you have two users always logged on, Hans?
2012-02-22 10:59:18 HansFangohr: Anders, these are from machines that are never switched off.
2012-02-22 11:45:02 HansFangohr: Anders, Marc-Antonio, just to say that I am not having lunch today.
2012-02-23 09:05:19 HansFangohr: Good Morning Anders and Gabriel.
2012-02-23 09:07:09 andersej: Good morning to both of you, and DokosBot!
2012-02-23 09:22:19 GabrielB: Good morning Anders and Hans
2012-02-23 09:53:13 GabrielB: Hans are we ok to meet in 7 minutes?
2012-02-23 09:53:52 andersej: He'll try. Says it might be 9.
2012-02-23 09:56:10 GabrielB: lol ok
2012-02-23 15:37:34 mb8g11: hello Marijaan
2012-02-23 22:08:56 mb8g11: good night
2012-02-23 22:09:02 mb8g11: oh, weiwei was here
2012-02-24 08:28:41 mb8g11: good morning
2012-02-24 09:02:54 fangohr: Morning folks :)
2012-02-24 09:09:04 fangohr-osiris: Morning Anders, are you out there?
2012-02-24 09:13:23 andersej: Yes, I'm here! Good morning! Just reading your email. What is your queries?
2012-02-24 09:13:37 andersej: Ok, just got it.
2012-02-24 10:52:58 andersej: Hans, great work on the documentation! Just one question: Now it seems one have to add the modules to index.rst in addition to modules.txt. This can easily be solved by a simple script copying the information from modules.txt into index.rst. Do you want such a script? I can add it in ten minutes.
2012-02-24 10:57:07 fangohr: I think in index.rst we want to sort them in a logical order, whereas for the modules.txt the order probably doesn't matter? I would think that it is okay to do this manually in this instance. Maybe a note that one needs to add NEW modules to both files might be useful as reminder (in the thisdocumentation.rst file, say).
2012-02-24 11:03:29 andersej: That's right, the order in modules.txt doesn't matter, as it will be arranged alphabetically in the html file. I guess one will get a warning when building if a new module is just added in one of the files and not both.
2012-02-27 09:01:30 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-02-27 09:01:32 fangohr: Morning Anders and DokosBot!
2012-02-27 09:02:52 fangohr: I have a query for you -- do you mind coming to my office for a moment?
2012-02-27 09:04:47 andersej: I'll be there in a second.
2012-02-27 09:05:27 fangohr: Great, there is no rush.
2012-02-27 09:47:55 fangohr-osiris: Wasn't happy with Empathy as the IRC client on linux. Now trying xchat.
2012-02-27 10:04:36 andersej: Hans, when I try to clone the repository in my home folder on your computer, I get "andersej@osiris:~$ hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/fangohr/finmag remote: Permission denied (publickey). abort: no suitable response from remote hg!", and when I try running from your repository I get permission denied error because I (ffc) am not allowed to write to your folder (ffc wants to create a compiled cache file).
2012-02-27 10:05:56 fangohr: You get the ssh key error because the new account has a different ssh key then the one your machine. Try to checkout via https -- then you have to enter the bitbucket password, and it should work.
2012-02-27 10:07:01 andersej: Great, it works, thanks!
2012-02-27 10:48:28 andersej: I can confirm that /dynamics/macrospin/test_analytic.py runs without problem on my computer with petsc 3.2-p5. I tried installing the newest petsc locally in my home directory on your computer, Hans, but it doesn't like using the new version as it already has an older version built and installed using sudo. I've tried setting petsci_dir and petsc_arch without any luck. Will try a couple of other approaches before the weekly meeting.
2012-02-27 10:52:29 fangohr: Thank you nice -- I'll try to upgrade PETSC then. Let me do this before you try anything else.
2012-02-27 11:24:48 fangohr: Andersej, thanks -- have upgraded ubuntu, then re-installed fenics (as in the finmag/install/fresh-on-ubuntu/fenics.sh) and now the problem has disappeared.
2012-02-27 11:25:13 andersej: Great!
2012-02-28 14:40:42 fangohr_: Hi MarcAntonio, are you out there?
2012-02-28 14:45:22 mb8g11: Yes I am!
2012-02-28 14:45:40 mb8g11: who
2012-02-28 14:49:23 mb8g11: What can I do?
2012-02-28 14:53:05 fangohr_: Hi, just seen the latest commit with the timings - thank you.
2012-02-28 14:53:06 fangohr_: G
2012-02-28 14:53:18 fangohr_: Good to see how profiling can be done here.
2012-02-28 14:54:51 mb8g11: :) Currently writing the spinwaves finmag script, but will get back to the exchange computation afterwards. It's by far the most expensive thing we currently do.
2012-02-28 14:55:14 fangohr_: Some observations: when I ran this, my (virtual machine) spend a long time after displaying 'ordering nodes' or something. Not sure what this is, but it seems related to the mesh generation.
2012-02-28 14:56:05 mb8g11: I think it's just the last thing it does before running the integrator. Because there is no new output until the end, the message seems to be there for a long time. At least that was my impression.
2012-02-28 14:56:20 mb8g11: Let me check that again quickly.
2012-02-28 14:57:12 fangohr_: Oh that could be right.
2012-02-28 14:57:36 fangohr_: I have in fact just added some print statements to address this, and committed, but need to merge now before pushing back.
2012-02-28 14:58:43 mb8g11: Yes that's the situation.
2012-02-28 14:58:45 mb8g11: Great.
2012-02-28 14:59:50 mb8g11: Doesn't seem to run with the default tolerances anymore. I could have sweared I checked it out before checking it in...
2012-02-28 15:00:41 fangohr_: Okay, same here. I will just push back my changes -- still doesn't run, but doesn't affect my additions I think.
2012-02-28 15:01:12 mb8g11: Or add rtol=1e-3 to the set_integrator arguments. If not, I'll do it, no worries.
2012-02-28 15:02:15 fangohr_: Too late ;-)
2012-02-28 15:02:48 mb8g11: Haha.
2012-02-28 15:04:13 mb8g11: I wonder why it didn't break the build. I guess it works *sometimes*.
2012-02-28 15:04:19 fangohr_: Jenkins says this compiles fine. Indeed.
2012-02-28 15:04:26 fangohr_: Also, do we know why building is now much faster?
2012-02-28 15:04:45 mb8g11: No.
2012-02-28 15:04:54 fangohr_: Thinking of http://summer.kk.soton.ac.uk:8080/job/finmag/buildTimeTrend
2012-02-28 15:07:50 mb8g11: Well, it's still too long. That's mostly the fault of the exchange 3D test.
2012-02-28 15:08:25 fangohr_: This is example is useful documentation how to use the same mesh for nmag and finmag comparison. In general, it should be sufficient to just mesh the same geometry (as in the limit of infinitely fine meshes we expect the answers to be identical, and expect reasonable agreement for reasonable meshes anyway). We can then use teh command dolfin.Box, dolfin.Rectangle etc to create the mesh in dolfin. Nmag is lacking the directly comparab
2012-02-28 15:08:26 fangohr_: command, but there is the 'examesh' executable that does something something similar. Anyway, this is just a generic remark for the future.
2012-02-28 15:11:51 fangohr_: Another idea: instead of checking the value at a particular node, I would check the value at a particular position. In dolfin we can use m((x,y,z)) to get the value of the Function m at (x,y,z), in Nmag we can use sim.probe_subfield_siv('m_Py',(x,y,z)) or equivalent. Both access methods will interpolate the true field, but the results should be comparable. The advantage of this approach is that we are independent of the mesh, and in
2012-02-28 15:11:51 fangohr_: particular the order of nodes in the mesh. Nmag may change the order of the nodes when it starts (in particular when run using MPI on more than 1 node), and I expect dolfin may do this as well. Again, just a general remark before I forget.
2012-02-28 15:12:00 mb8g11: Personally, I think it's much more difficult to compare data with oommf, because the values you get out are the middle of a cell. Is there some nmag code that does that? Would love to see it.
2012-02-28 15:12:39 mb8g11: Oooh, m((x,y,z)) really? Thanks!
2012-02-28 15:14:00 fangohr_: I tink I know why it doesn't fail: the exit status ($? for bash if I remember correctly) suggests that the return value is 0 despite the vode warning. So Jenkins wouldn't know this. As it is just a warning, it is not actually a failure of the integration - it just says that it needed suspiciously many iterations. (and we should of course understand why). I am not sure what the implication for the result is, but as your assert stateme
2012-02-28 15:14:01 fangohr_: are not triggered, it can't have been too bad?
2012-02-28 15:14:47 mb8g11: True.
2012-02-28 15:18:17 mb8g11: I failed at merging again. Aaaah.
2012-02-28 15:18:39 fangohr_: OOMMF: I think the best you can do is to compare with FE data where you probe the FE field at the position of the centre of the cube in OOMMF. On the other hand, for mesh edge length -> 0, we get the same result (or should), so if we just allow a bit more tolerance, this should be fine. I wouldn't worry about this too much.
2012-02-28 15:19:09 fangohr_: Does the mesh generation take a lot of time? This will affect the regression tests as well. Something to consider.
2012-02-28 15:22:29 mb8g11: @oommf, fine, makes sense
2012-02-28 15:23:31 mb8g11: @mesh generation. Not an awful lot in comparison with the actual simulation, but a few seconds here and there add up. What time should we be aiming for? 10s for the unit tests?
2012-02-28 15:24:36 mb8g11: We can't really do true TDD, as our tests consist of solving physical problems and not inserting a row into a database. That takes time.
2012-02-28 15:24:54 mb8g11: Because ideally, tests should run in <1s.
2012-02-28 15:28:25 fangohr_: I agree the mesh generation is relatively fast; although changing to dolfin.Box where possible is desirable (as it will be faster for a cubic geometry than going to an external package for a generic geometry).
2012-02-28 15:28:48 fangohr_: If tests take 10 seconds, I think that's fine. As you say, at some point we need to test  some physics, and that takes time.
2012-02-28 15:31:18 fangohr_: Regarding the run-time of this one (src/finmag/sim/tests/dynamics_3D): the profiler says that more than 50% are spend it 'assemble'. I can only think of the exchange assemble command that is called repeatedlyfor every iteration. Thus we need to check whether we can make this faster by storing the matrix rather than assembling every time. See https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/25041739
2012-02-28 15:32:04 andersej: I'm working on it.
2012-02-28 15:32:17 fangohr_: Great, thanks.
2012-02-28 15:32:53 fangohr_: (I have looked into the UFL manual, following repeated recommendations from Marc-Antonio and later Dmitri. That seems a useful resource indeed.)
2012-02-28 15:34:45 mb8g11: @assembly: Yes, it's in fact significantly more than 50% and what I wanted to say at 14:54. Maybe I can join you Anders, in an hour or so?
2012-02-28 15:35:00 andersej: Yes, the documentation of ufl modules isn't very good, so the manual is the right place to obtain information.
2012-02-28 15:35:19 andersej: That'll be great, MarcAntonio.
2012-02-28 15:36:07 mb8g11: Now that I know how to probe the field in dolfin, I will throw out the mesh generation for dolfin for the periodic spinwaves. Thanks!
2012-02-28 15:36:56 mb8g11: Just need to manage to revert a file to an old version before that. That sure is tricky!
2012-02-28 15:40:10 mb8g11: (meant 3D example btw.)
2012-02-28 23:07:28 16WAAC4L4: Update: bitbucket may be a little unresponsive: I noted that my 'hg fetch' or 'hg pull' requests did time out. I interrupted them. Jenkins now seems to suffer the same fate -- it has been running 'hg pull' sinnce 22:47; and thus it does not build due to the latest changes. I would hope that Jenkins migth kill the pull job at some point, or that bitbucket recovers. Let's see.
2012-02-28 23:07:44 16WAAC4L4: I am Hans, by the way. Sorry about the funny login.
2012-02-29 09:24:21 fangohr: Morning all.
2012-02-29 09:24:39 andersej: Morning!
2012-02-29 10:10:09 GabrielB: Hi everyone
2012-02-29 10:14:27 mb8g11: Hi all.
2012-02-29 10:14:33 GabrielB: Hi Marc
2012-02-29 10:18:32 andersej: Hello, mb8g11 and GabrielB!
2012-02-29 10:19:38 GabrielB: HI anders
2012-02-29 11:52:17 mb8g11: I have a PGR meeting with catering at 1300 and won't go to lunch today.
2012-02-29 12:13:36 andersej: Okay, I know how you love free food, hehe..
2012-02-29 12:25:27 mb8g11: Exactly!
2012-02-29 13:34:36 fangohr_: Hi Anders, I think I know what's wrong with the exchange. A subtle bug, that I have put in earlier.
2012-02-29 13:39:03 andersej: What do you mean? The problem that makes the odeint diverge? Or is there another problem? I know that the project method isn't working very good, is this because of the bug?
2012-02-29 13:39:34 fangohr_: A different issue -- do you want to come over briefly?
2012-02-29 13:44:51 andersej: Yes, just found another bug. Two seconds, pushing now.
2012-02-29 13:45:41 fangohr_: Probably the same as I did :) Let's see. ;-)
2012-02-29 15:05:47 fangohr: Yes, spotted the same missing 'raise'. I was not asked to merge it manually, so I guess we made *exactly* the same change to the same line, and merge can deal with that silently (assuming that if we both agree what it should be, this will be the right way to merge it). Clever.
2012-02-29 15:29:59 andersej: Hehe, good!
2012-02-29 15:30:58 andersej: Someone knows where these "Create layout  End Create layout" - messages are coming from?
2012-02-29 15:31:14 fangohr: No. When do you see them?
2012-02-29 15:31:51 andersej: python explicit_g_matrix.py
2012-02-29 15:32:23 andersej: Seems like they occur in every methods.
2012-02-29 15:33:25 fangohr: I don't think I can see these at all.
2012-02-29 15:34:21 andersej: Interesting. I'll try running the script from your machine.
2012-02-29 15:37:37 andersej: Right, I don't get those messages there...
2012-02-29 15:38:03 fangohr: Maybe you have set some loglevel higher than normal or some other setting in your user account that triggers this behaviour?
2012-02-29 15:41:42 andersej: Probably something like that, yes, but I have never changed any such thing on this machine. It is probably due to different versions of ffc, ufl, etc. Nothing to worry about.
2012-02-29 17:09:17 fangohr: exit
2012-03-01 09:12:17 fangohr_: Morning Anders.
2012-03-01 09:12:50 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-03-01 09:24:31 andersej: I've just changed all my email addresses on Jenkins to the Soton-address and pushed my code. We'll see in a few minutes if it worked.
2012-03-01 09:27:02 andersej: Yey! It worked!
2012-03-01 09:27:12 fangohr_: Great, thanks.
2012-03-01 11:35:16 andersej: Hi all! I think the documentation for Exchange and Anisotropy is a bit strange, since it displays all these functions we only use internally. The user should only use exchange.compute_field(), but this is not mentioned in the documentation. But all the compute_filed_box_assemble, etc, are listed, but cannot be used. I've made a big change and gathered all methods in compute_field(). I've pushed it now, so please have a look and if you don't like i
2012-03-01 11:35:16 andersej: t, we can revert immediately.
2012-03-01 11:35:45 andersej: That is, I've just changed the Exchange for now.
2012-03-01 11:56:38 mb8g11: Why didn't you just prefix these methods with __ ?
2012-03-01 11:57:34 mb8g11: And since the documentation is only for us, it wouldn't hurt to see the different methods. But that is a matter of taste I guess.
2012-03-01 11:57:42 andersej: I could have done that, and added a dummy method compute_field() with only documentation.
2012-03-01 12:05:14 mb8g11: Do you mind if I edit the file a little, or are you currently working on it?
2012-03-01 12:05:33 andersej: No, please do.
2012-03-01 12:05:39 mb8g11: :)
2012-03-01 12:35:28 mb8g11: pushed
2012-03-01 12:40:13 fangohr: Just in time for lunch, I suppose :)
2012-03-01 12:44:21 mb8g11: Yes!
2012-03-01 12:45:21 fangohr: Just noticed that I broke the build before ... hopefully just fixed it with a new commit.
2012-03-01 14:18:31 fangohr: Marc-Antonio, turns out that Marijan is delayed, so I have some time now -- shall we look at your tests now then?
2012-03-01 14:23:24 mb8g11: Yes ofc
2012-03-01 16:44:40 fangohr: Hi MA, I have got 10 minutes left before the end of the day -- have we covered all the issues or is there anything else we should talk about now?
2012-03-01 16:44:58 mb8g11: I think that's it really :)
2012-03-01 16:45:11 fangohr: That's fine - great. ;)
2012-03-02 09:10:50 fangohr: Morning Anders, I like you conclusion that -- due to the various logins in the IRC chat -- I must be very experienced with it.
2012-03-02 09:11:14 fangohr: In any case, I need to do deal with some urgent things but hope that we can get together in 30 minutes or so - is that oka?
2012-03-02 09:11:19 fangohr: (okay)
2012-03-02 09:18:36 andersej: Good morning, Hans! Hehe.. Yes, 30 minutes sounds great. I'll come by then.
2012-03-02 09:45:44 fangohr: Not quite finished yet, I'll give you a shout when I am done.
2012-03-02 09:45:57 andersej: Ok.
2012-03-02 09:58:06 fangohr: Hi Anders, ready to fire now. Do you want to come over?
2012-03-02 09:59:08 andersej: Yes!
2012-03-02 11:03:08 fangohr: Anders, I was wrong. The student comes at 11:30. I'll come over to your office in 5 minutes and we can look at your files for 20 minutes.
2012-03-02 16:11:30 andersej: Hans, are you still there?
2012-03-02 16:13:02 andersej: Never mind, I solved the problem.
2012-03-02 16:15:09 andersej: That is, not THE problem, just another one..
2012-03-02 17:06:39 fangohr: Hi Anders, yes, still there. Too late now I guess. Let's talk Monday.
2012-03-02 17:06:45 fangohr: ; have a good weekend everybody.
2012-03-05 09:48:55 fangohr: Moin Anders.
2012-03-05 10:23:21 andersej: Morning!
2012-03-05 12:57:28 fangohr: Up for lunch?
2012-03-05 12:57:33 andersej: Yes!
2012-03-05 14:42:28 fangohr: Anders, do you know whether we have any Ubuntu installation CDs lying around in the office? Don't worry if not -- just wanted to check before burning a new one.
2012-03-05 14:42:58 andersej: No, I'm not aware of any such CDs. Sorry.
2012-03-05 14:44:50 andersej: By the way, do you have two seconds while the CD is burning?
2012-03-05 14:45:00 fangohr: Yes, sure :)
2012-03-05 14:45:18 andersej: I'll send you an email and come to your office.
2012-03-05 16:39:19 fangohr: Hi Maxim, well done.
2012-03-05 16:41:06 maxim__: the uk layout is confusing me. had troubles with password because of exchanged y and z ;)
2012-03-05 17:10:20 fangohr: Hi Maxim, am about to leave. I see you tomorrow around 11;00 or so. Have a nice evening.
2012-03-05 17:18:39 maxim__: Thanks, you too.
2012-03-06 09:06:59 fangohr: Good Morning, Anders.
2012-03-06 09:07:07 andersej: Morning, Hans!
2012-03-06 09:20:59 fangohr: Morning Anders, are the 'project vs interpolate' results to spectacular that we should file a query on the dolfin team list?
2012-03-06 09:27:20 andersej: Perhaps. I've sent a mail to Anders Logg showing the results and asked why project acts as it does. Either he has a good explanation or he encourages us to file it as a bug. I'll just wait until he wakes up, hehe..
2012-03-06 09:27:40 fangohr: Sure, thanks. Let me know the answer :)
2012-03-06 11:51:12 fangohr: Hi Sebastian, good to see you :)
2012-03-06 11:51:28 SebastianS: hey, jep just managed to set up IRC
2012-03-06 11:51:43 fangohr: I need to make a few phone calls but would hope we can go for lunch around 12:30 maybe?
2012-03-06 11:52:07 SebastianS: sounds good. I have one quick questions though:
2012-03-06 11:52:27 SebastianS: could you invite me again to the dropbox folder? that didn't seem to work
2012-03-06 11:52:47 SebastianS: it's sebastian.schwieger@uni-konstanz.de
2012-03-06 11:54:04 fangohr: Yes, sorry, had a typo in the email address.
2012-03-06 11:54:38 SebastianS: no worries! just got the invite. Thanks a lot
2012-03-06 11:54:49 andersej: 12:30 sounds good!
2012-03-06 12:27:25 andersej: We are leaving for lunch now. We meet up outside my office (next to the exit).
2012-03-06 12:28:11 andersej: 2025 is the number..
2012-03-06 12:31:35 fangohr: Maxim, Sebastian, we can't find you anywhere -- I presume you have gone to the staff club already, so we meet you there.
2012-03-06 13:02:52 maxims: Nilson (or Nelson) asked me whether I go with him for lunch. But then I realized that we were not going to eat in staff club but buy food in this student shop instead. Sebastian is picking up his id card. I hope you met him on your way. Otherwise I can show some where he can have lunch.
2012-03-06 14:12:20 fangohr: Sebastian -- what is your login?
2012-03-06 14:17:46 fangohr: Got it: ss18g11 (thanks).
2012-03-06 14:20:25 fangohr: I created an account for you on eta.kk.soton.ac.uk. Password is 'konstanz', please change asap. You connect using 'ssh ss18g11@eta.kk.soton.ac.uk'.
2012-03-06 14:22:34 SebastianS: oh sorry! i didn't have the sound on and completely forgot to check here.
2012-03-06 14:22:40 SebastianS: thanks a lot!
2012-03-06 14:24:47 fangohr: Hi all, I'll be teaching and offline for the rest of the day.
2012-03-06 14:36:31 SebastianS: clear
2012-03-06 14:36:53 SebastianS: uups... that was supposed to go in terminal
2012-03-06 14:36:58 SebastianS: sorry for that
2012-03-07 10:05:01 andersej: Hans, are you out there?
2012-03-07 11:57:17 andersej: Lunch, anyone? maxims or SebastianS?
2012-03-07 12:08:31 SebastianS: ah we just went to the shops and bought some small snacks there
2012-03-07 12:08:46 SebastianS: we actually thought you guys had already gone there
2012-03-07 12:09:38 andersej: Okay, that's fine. Let's try again tomorrow!
2012-03-07 12:11:27 maxims: Do you eat every day at staff club? For me it would be to expensive. But two or three times a week is ok. So maybe tomorrow?
2012-03-07 12:12:59 andersej: Yes, we usually eat there. Just send a message here when you want to join us.
2012-03-07 12:15:06 maxims: Ok
2012-03-07 12:22:38 maxims: SebastianS: im Ordner /home/benutzername muss die Datei .hgrc angelegt werden und deren Inhalt ist:
2012-03-07 12:23:04 maxims: SebastianS: [ui]
2012-03-07 12:23:04 maxims: username = Maxim Skripnik <maxim.skripnik@yahoo.de>
2012-03-07 12:23:39 SebastianS: ah okay, danke :-)
2012-03-08 09:19:20 fangohr: Good Morning Anders and DokosBot.
2012-03-08 09:22:18 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-03-08 09:22:50 andersej: I have a bunch of questions. Do you have three and a half minute?
2012-03-08 09:23:29 fangohr: Yes, give me 5 minutes to do some email, and then will be good. I'll send a short message here when I am done.
2012-03-08 09:24:01 andersej: Great!
2012-03-08 09:36:49 fangohr: Okay Anders, do you want to come over, or do I need to see your screen?
2012-03-08 09:37:18 andersej: I'm on my way!
2012-03-08 11:06:06 fangohr: Hi Sebastian. Not sure you can afford the food in the staff club (seeing your messages from yesterday), but Anders and I will go at 12:15 today. (One should be able to keep the price below 5.00 generally; the curry is exceptionally expensive.)
2012-03-08 11:09:19 SebastianS: Hi Hans, that message was acutally from Maxim, although I had the same concerns... I think I'll join you today, though and have a second go ;-)
2012-03-08 11:18:08 fangohr: Sadly, the 'student' places are not cheaper ... Actually, when you pay, you should say that you are a student, and you should get a reduction (20% or so). They will want to see your student card for this. The Southampton card you have is a visitor's card; so that is not a student card. But if you have some kind of student card from Konstanz, and explain that you are here as a visiting student, it may work. If I am around, I'll back you up. Worth a try
2012-03-08 11:22:37 SebastianS: I actually did that Monday and the lady at the pay desk told me she'd do it only this time as the curry was quite expensive; I guess she won't remember me, though, so it should be fine
2012-03-08 12:13:31 SebastianS: are you guys going to lunch? Maxim and I would be ready
2012-03-08 12:13:47 fangohr: Yes, let's meet outside Anders office in 2 min or so.
2012-03-08 12:14:00 SebastianS: okay. see you then
2012-03-08 22:35:17 fangohr__: Hi Dmitri -- nice to see you here. (Or probably just your computer being logged in) :)
2012-03-12 10:02:39 fangohr: Morning folks.
2012-03-12 10:19:08 SebastianS: I was just looking through the first couple of NMAG examples and I was wondering whether number 11 (Cubic anisotropy) would be a good point to start.
2012-03-12 10:32:22 fangohr: I would probably start with a system without anisotropy, say

2012-03-12 10:32:22 fangohr: Then, you may want to do something with uniaxial anisotropy (as this is the anisotropy considered in theLLB model), say
2012-03-12 10:32:22 fangohr: http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/nmag/0.2/manual/html/example_uniaxial_anis/doc.html
2012-03-12 10:33:10 fangohr: When you have mastered these, standard problem 3 may be nice to do (http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~rdm/spec3.html). When you get to that point, let me know and I will dig out the Nmag script which you can use for initial guidance.
2012-03-12 10:35:14 SebastianS: okay. thanks a lot!
2012-03-12 12:08:17 maxim|s: Is anybody going to have lunch at staff club?
2012-03-12 12:26:31 fangohr: Oh, yes!
2012-03-12 12:26:46 fangohr: We are planning to go at 12:30 -- do you want to come over to Dmitri's and Anders' office now?
2012-03-12 16:58:57 SebastianS: Sorry to bother you again, Hans. I just noticed that the second example you recommended is the one, which Dmitri already did. I took a look if there were any other uniaxial ones, but I couldn't find any. Shall I skip that and go straight to the mumag example?
2012-03-12 17:10:23 fangohr: Yes.
2012-03-12 17:11:40 SebastianS: okay. Thanks!
2012-03-13 09:35:38 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-03-13 09:35:55 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-03-13 10:03:48 fangohr__: Good Morning.
2012-03-13 11:48:02 SebastianS: Hey, Maxim and I are in for lunch! We'll come to Anders office at around 12.30 if that's okay
2012-03-13 12:03:47 andersej: Great! I think we will be a large group today!
2012-03-13 12:19:09 fangohr: Okay, nice.
2012-03-14 09:02:00 andersej: Good morning!
2012-03-14 09:37:34 fangohr: Greetings Anders and DokosBot.
2012-03-14 09:40:21 andersej: Hehe.. Good morning!
2012-03-14 11:55:34 fangohr: Hi all, just to remind you that I am not going for lunch today.
2012-03-14 11:56:08 fangohr: I might get some biscutis for coffee, though. Shall we say 15:15 in Anders' and Gabriel's office? (I need to do something at 15:00 -- thus the strange time).
2012-03-14 12:06:30 andersej: 15.15 sounds great. Gabriel and I will go for lunch now, if anyone wants to join.
2012-03-14 12:08:52 SebastianS: Maxim and I are probably going a bit later, because we both didn't have breakfast so long ago...
2012-03-14 14:08:12 fangohr: :)
2012-03-14 17:21:24 fangohr: over and out, see you tomorrow.
2012-03-15 09:12:46 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-03-15 09:13:03 fangohr: Morning Sir.
2012-03-15 09:13:16 fangohr: I'll catch up with you soon. Is Gabriel in already?
2012-03-15 09:13:23 andersej: No, not yet.
2012-03-15 09:13:37 fangohr: Okay, that suits me fine .Need to fix something I broke earlier first :)
2012-03-15 09:13:49 andersej: : )
2012-03-15 12:28:04 andersej: Someone up for lunch?
2012-03-15 12:29:14 SebastianS: yes, sounds good! if it's okay with you we might wait for another 5 minutes or so, since maxim wanted to join in as well, but he's currently in the library
2012-03-15 12:29:36 andersej: Yes, 5 is ok.
2012-03-15 15:33:54 GabrielB:           kwargs = {"R"+str(i):R[i] for i in range(dim)}
2012-03-15 15:33:54 GabrielB:           E = Expression(w,**kwargs)
2012-03-15 15:34:12 andersej: Great!
2012-03-16 09:27:07 fangohr: Good Morning Anders (morning DokosBot).
2012-03-16 09:36:25 fangohr: Anders, are you around so that I can come over and admire your BEM progress bar?
2012-03-16 09:40:20 andersej: Yes! Please come!
2012-03-16 12:07:30 fangohr: Hi all, anybody up for lunch?
2012-03-16 12:07:42 andersej: I'm in.
2012-03-16 12:08:00 SebastianS: hey, I'm in as well
2012-03-16 12:08:01 fangohr: I need to be back by 13:00 for a meeting, so would want to leave at 12:15. Sharp. German punctuality and all that.
2012-03-16 12:08:25 andersej: Great.
2012-03-16 12:08:26 SebastianS: right. I'll be at Anders office :D
2012-03-16 12:09:03 andersej: Hans, can you come 12:14?
2012-03-16 12:09:19 fangohr: Have you something to show me?
2012-03-16 12:11:51 andersej: I (we) have a problem...
2012-03-16 14:14:13 fangohr: ...which you have now reported as https://bugs.launchpad.net/dolfin/+bug/956939. fortunately, it does not affect the 1.0 version.
2012-03-16 14:17:46 andersej: True and correct.
2012-03-16 14:21:52 andersej: The bad thing is that when we first use the CR element and then project onto a discontinous Lagrange space, I think we loose all possibility of telling which vector corresponds to which coordinate.
2012-03-16 14:32:48 andersej: I think perhaps we have to find a way to do this with CG elements. We can talk more about this on Monday.
2012-03-16 14:39:53 fangohr: Not sure I understand the problem with the vectors and coordinates.
2012-03-16 14:46:28 andersej: I'm not sure I understand it myself. But in the nmag example, they printed the demag field for given values of x. In our case that will be difficult, because we don't have the information of which vector corresponds to the x-coordinates of the mesh. Actually, there will be no vector on that exact coordinate, because the nodes on a CR element are between the coordinates.
2012-03-16 15:25:18 fangohr: Anders, the trick is to ask the dolfin field object. If the field object is called Hdem, then Hdem((x,y,z)) will give you the field at position (x,y,z). It will interpolate if required.
2012-03-16 15:26:02 andersej: Ah, I see.
2012-03-16 15:36:01 andersej: Can that interpolation also do something with the following problem? With all the other fields, the length of the gradient is three times the number of nodes. Which makes sense for a continuous Lagrange space. But the demag gradient is much longer since it exists in another space. Are we supposed to add these gradients at some time?
2012-03-16 15:47:01 andersej: We can talk more about this next week. Have a nice weekend everybody!
2012-03-16 16:15:50 fangohr: If we project the final demag field into a CG1 space, all should be fine. I hope.
2012-03-16 16:52:17 SebastianS: I'm off as well. Have a nice weekend!
2012-03-16 16:52:51 fangohr: Me too. Bye DokosBot.
2012-03-19 09:03:08 mb8g11: Hi all.
2012-03-19 09:03:22 andersej: Hi! Welcome back!
2012-03-19 09:18:24 andersej: Morning, Hans!
2012-03-19 09:18:28 fangohr: Morning all.
2012-03-19 09:18:42 fangohr: Marc-Antonio, are you back in Soton already, or logged in from HH?
2012-03-19 09:18:49 fangohr: Or South Africa, in fact ;-)
2012-03-19 09:19:14 mb8g11: No no, sitting in my office :)
2012-03-19 09:19:22 fangohr: Lovely :)
2012-03-19 09:23:35 andersej: Hi Hans, is there a Monday morning meeting today?
2012-03-19 09:36:02 fangohr: Yes, was just about to email.
2012-03-19 11:11:18 mb8g11: Does any of you know if Gabriel is currently working? I have to move some of his files to repair the build.
2012-03-19 11:35:17 fangohr: He is writing emails, at least.
2012-03-19 12:32:10 fangohr__: Are we set for lunch?
2012-03-19 12:32:37 fangohr: Meeting outside Dmitri's office, I suggest.
2012-03-19 12:33:08 andersej: I'm ready!
2012-03-19 12:34:06 SebastianS:   jep we'll be there in a minute as well
2012-03-19 14:49:20 fangohr: Anders, do you know whether Gabriel is fixing the broken built?
2012-03-19 14:50:05 fangohr: I have inserted a few 'finmag.' all over his code in the import statements, and it is running now on my machine.
2012-03-19 14:50:20 fangohr: Tempted to push but don't want to interfer with him ...
2012-03-19 14:50:37 andersej: No, I haven't heard anything.
2012-03-19 14:51:01 fangohr: Okay, I'll drop him an email and if there is no protest, I'll push.
2012-03-19 14:53:04 fangohr: Actually, I am guessing that his PYTHONPATH points to 'hg/finmag/src/finmag' instead of 'hg/finmag/src' -- if so, then all his code would run correctly I think. ;-)
2012-03-19 14:56:27 andersej: I'll wait until you have pushed this to push my tests.
2012-03-19 15:01:40 mb8g11: Anders, have you oommf installed on your machine?
2012-03-19 15:02:01 fangohr: Anders, I have pushed already -- do you get bitbucket email notifications?
2012-03-19 15:02:26 andersej: No to both of you.
2012-03-19 15:03:35 fangohr: :) Then I suggest you (and maybe also Maxim?) set up automatic email notification on pushs to bitbucket. You do this by going to the 'admin' tab when you are on the bitbucket project, then select 'Services' (on the left), then add the 'Email diff'service, and enter the email address that should get the notifications.
2012-03-19 15:06:19 mb8g11: He shouldn't be able to see an admin tab at all.
2012-03-19 15:06:34 fangohr: Eh, yes. Right you are.
2012-03-19 15:07:16 fangohr: So is it not possible to schedule this for ordinary users? Marc-Antonio, have you got email notification?
2012-03-19 15:07:28 fangohr: I can add email addresses for everybody if you like, just say.
2012-03-19 15:08:50 andersej: Yes please, but for A.E.Johansen@soton.ac.uk, so I don't get email notifications to my phone at 07 am Sunday morning, hehe..
2012-03-19 15:10:40 mb8g11: It isn't possible for ordinary users and I haven't got e-mail notifactions. I simply try pulling or have the bitbucket website open.
2012-03-19 15:11:09 fangohr: Marc-Antonio, I can add your email to the email-diff service if you like?
2012-03-19 15:11:10 mb8g11: A normal user could program his e-mail client to read the RSS feed of the repository though,.
2012-03-19 15:12:16 mb8g11: no thanks :)
2012-03-19 15:12:40 andersej: Actually, I always have the website open myself, so I think the e-mail notifications would just be disturbing. So could you perhaps please not add me? I get Pivotaltracker e-mails anyway when somebody pushes to stories I'm working on.
2012-03-19 15:33:34 fangohr: Sure, makes sense.
2012-03-19 15:34:09 fangohr: ... and as Marc-Antonio says, you could also subscribe to the RSS feed if you like to see stuff arriving in your inbox rather than the browser.
2012-03-19 15:45:32 fangohr: Anders, does the xfail-decorator work? If so, could you commit please? I'd like to get a successful built on Jenkins.
2012-03-19 15:46:03 fangohr: If the decorator does not work, just rename the file from test_ to xtest_ or so (or the same with the function names if you just need to disable a few test functions inside a file).
2012-03-19 15:46:04 mb8g11: Anders is busy parametrising his tests :D
2012-03-19 15:46:26 fangohr: Not exactly sure what it means -- but it sounds like work in progress. Good enough for me. Ta.
2012-03-19 15:46:30 andersej: But my tests won't break the build anyway, because all asserts are commented out.
2012-03-19 15:47:07 fangohr: Hm, then something else breaks it. Have a look at: http://summer.kk.soton.ac.uk:8080/job/finmag/lastBuild/console
2012-03-19 15:47:46 mb8g11: progressbar
2012-03-19 15:48:18 andersej: Of course
2012-03-19 15:48:36 andersej: My nice little progressbar
2012-03-19 15:53:07 andersej: Let's see now.
2012-03-19 15:58:44 andersej: Old version of pytest on jenkins breaks the build. MA is on the case.
2012-03-19 15:58:55 fangohr: Fails now at 'import py.test'.
2012-03-19 15:59:02 fangohr: Is it the version or is pytest not installed?
2012-03-19 15:59:11 fangohr: If you tell me what to change, I'll change it ;)
2012-03-19 15:59:27 mb8g11: summer has py.test 1.3.4 instead of the new one... could you update it?
2012-03-19 15:59:44 mb8g11: should be sudo easy_install -U pytest
2012-03-19 15:59:53 fangohr: Can't be done with Ubuntu packages?
2012-03-19 16:00:19 mb8g11: No.
2012-03-19 16:01:44 fangohr: fangohr@summer:~$ dpkg -S `which py.test`
2012-03-19 16:01:44 fangohr: python-py: /usr/bin/py.test
2012-03-19 16:02:03 fangohr: So I uninstall python-py, and run the 'sudo easy_install -U pytest'?
2012-03-19 16:04:47 mb8g11: We didn't uninstall python-py on Anders machine.
2012-03-19 16:05:56 mb8g11: easy_install created a py.test-2.x. We pointed a symbolic link name py.test to it, and backed up the existing py.test as py.test-old
2012-03-19 16:06:42 fangohr__: Can you test whether all his stuff still works if you remove the Ubuntu package?
2012-03-19 16:08:02 andersej: Can you install the progressbar as well? apt-get install python-progressbar. Really nice to have when building the BEM.
2012-03-19 16:14:58 andersej: I just removed the Ubuntu package and everything seems fine.
2012-03-19 16:23:25 fangohr: Both done. fire away.
2012-03-19 16:39:47 andersej: Yey, success.
2012-03-19 16:50:40 fangohr: Phew ...
2012-03-19 17:10:48 fangohr: Over and out for the day.
2012-03-20 09:06:11 fangohr: Morning Gabriel (and Dokosbot)
2012-03-20 09:19:22 andersej: Good morning!
2012-03-20 11:51:34 mb8g11: Who is up for lunch?
2012-03-20 11:51:45 mb8g11: at 12:15 let's say
2012-03-20 11:51:50 fangohr__: I am.
2012-03-20 11:51:55 fangohr__: You are hungry...
2012-03-20 11:52:26 SebastianS: I'm in as well
2012-03-20 11:55:16 mb8g11: A little ;)
2012-03-20 12:12:01 andersej: I'm in!
2012-03-21 12:08:56 SebastianS: hey, anyone up for lunch?
2012-03-21 12:11:20 andersej: Marc-Antonio said he would be ready 12:30. Is it okay if we wait for him?
2012-03-21 12:14:43 SebastianS: yeah sure. I'm not in a rush
2012-03-21 12:15:50 andersej: Great. Let's meet at the usual place, outside my door, in 15 minutes then.
2012-03-21 12:25:48 mb8g11: I met Maxim at the gym, he won't be coming with us today.
2012-03-22 09:00:16 fangohr: Good Morning DokosBot and Marc-Antonio.
2012-03-22 12:06:48 fangohr: Hi all, I have a work meeting over lunch and will not be able to join you today.
2012-03-22 12:07:35 andersej: Okay, is anyone else up for some food?
2012-03-22 12:10:41 SebastianS: jep, I'd be up for lunch
2012-03-22 12:10:54 andersej: In ten minutes, say?
2012-03-22 12:11:07 SebastianS: sounds good
2012-03-22 12:11:15 andersej: Great!
2012-03-22 13:00:09 mb8g11: i.
2012-03-22 14:41:16 fangohr: Marc-Antonio, am just trying to run the compare_exchange.py code. This fails on my machine because I haven't set the path to OOMMF yet. Could you update the code so that it prints what command it will execute before it fails (or catch the failure, and only then print what it was trying to do?). I expect thsi will be useful repeatedly, i.e. whenever somebody tries to do this on a machine where OOMMF has not been setup for this kind of test.
2012-03-22 15:16:03 mb8g11: Yes.
2012-03-22 16:00:26 fangohr: Thank you.
2012-03-22 16:30:31 mb8g11: By the way, it isn't so much a path, as that you need to have "oommf" available as a command.
2012-03-22 16:31:25 fangohr__: Sure, that's actually what I expected. But one doesn't know whether the command is 'oommf' or 'oommf.sh' or 'oommf.tcl' etc.
2012-03-22 16:31:59 mb8g11: I'm on it now.
2012-03-22 16:58:11 mb8g11: Pushed :)
2012-03-22 16:58:19 fangohr: Ta.
2012-03-22 17:02:19 fangohr_: What is your 'oommf' script like? (if that question makes any sense.)
2012-03-22 17:06:50 mb8g11: Of course it does.
2012-03-22 17:07:00 mb8g11: It's an executable file in my path with:
2012-03-22 17:07:04 mb8g11: #! /bin/bash
2012-03-22 17:07:24 mb8g11: tclsh /whereever/your/oommf/is/oommf.tcl "$@"
2012-03-22 17:09:42 fangohr_: That's better; thank you.
2012-03-22 17:10:10 fangohr_: It might be worth including this file into the error message, or creating the file automatically after we compile oommf?
2012-03-22 17:10:56 fangohr_: I get one step further, but then oommf reports an error that it cannot read the mif file. [Need to stop here for today.]
2012-03-22 17:11:34 mb8g11: If it's okay, I'll stop by your office tomorrow morning?
2012-03-22 17:11:59 mb8g11: (will include this file into the installation script)
2012-03-22 17:12:49 fangohr: Yes, let's do that.
2012-03-22 20:33:36 mb8g11: Hi Hans.
2012-03-22 20:34:17 fangohr___: Hi :) am just installing oommf on summer.
2012-03-22 20:34:38 fangohr___: As we know create the oommf file automatically, we could include the TCL path settings into that file, right?
2012-03-22 20:35:18 fangohr___: (Summer is the machine hosting the Jenkins autotesting.)
2012-03-22 20:36:36 fangohr___: Marc-Antonio, by the way, have you ever tried 'Atlassian Sourcetree'? I is a Mac-only application for git and hg repositories and is meant to be great. Might give this a go at some point.
2012-03-22 20:38:42 mb8g11: Do we need the TCL path settings post-installation?
2012-03-22 20:39:46 fangohr___: Ah, good question. I assumed we had to, but never tested. Probably I am just wrong.
2012-03-22 20:40:00 mb8g11: Assuming you mean OOMMF_TCL_INCLUDE_DIR and TK, we don't :)
2012-03-22 20:40:13 mb8g11: It's just that the installation fails if they aren't defined.
2012-03-22 20:40:37 fangohr___: Anders, are you still there as well?
2012-03-22 20:40:44 mb8g11: Yes he is, we are fixing the build ;)
2012-03-22 20:41:03 mb8g11: Well, he is.. I prefer breaking it.
2012-03-22 20:42:34 mb8g11: @atlassian sourcetree: The screencast looks nice, will try it out!
2012-03-22 20:43:18 andersej: Yes, I'm here admiring the fact that we are 7 users on at this hour ;)
2012-03-22 20:44:15 mb8g11: 7? Did you count or shizophrenis as well? :)
2012-03-22 20:44:34 mb8g11: *schizophrenics
2012-03-22 20:44:48 andersej: Hehe...
2012-03-22 20:44:51 andersej: Yes
2012-03-22 20:45:17 fangohr___: The 3 chizophrenis are all here with me. Plus DokosBot, of course. And the two that actually do something useful :)
2012-03-22 20:45:54 fangohr___: (and the fourth I of course)
2012-03-22 20:46:05 andersej: Yes, we are quite busy in breaking Jenkins.
2012-03-22 20:46:37 fangohr___: Nice.
2012-03-22 20:46:54 fangohr___: One recipe for success seems to be to change the name of classes, such as src/finmag/demag/solver_gcr.py:71: in solve_phia
2012-03-22 20:46:54 fangohr___: >        super(GCRFemBemDeMagSolver,self).solve_phia(phia = self.phia,method = method)
2012-03-22 20:46:55 fangohr___: E        NameError: global name 'GCRFemBemDeMagSolver' is not defined
2012-03-22 20:48:44 andersej: I changed that, and then Gabriel pushed, and the merge haven't worked out the way I hoped. And we've had dinner..
2012-03-22 20:55:21 mb8g11: find . -name "*.py" -print | xargs sed -i 's/foo/bar/g'
2012-03-22 20:55:58 andersej: Thanks!
2012-03-22 20:56:23 mb8g11: np
2012-03-22 21:11:33 fangohr___: The merge couldn't figure out the name change because you didn't change the name in the tests? Anyway, it will need manual fixing, and looking at the latest email you have probably done that already?
2012-03-22 21:17:04 fangohr___: The other failure seems to relate to the Nitsche solver, and fail on my virtual machine as well. With a low level Dolfin warning.
2012-03-22 21:17:21 fangohr___: I would recommend to mark them as expected to fail, or comment out for now?
2012-03-22 21:19:07 andersej: I have solved all problems related to the name change now. The Nitsche solver failed before I pushed anything today, so that isn't related to the name change. I can mark them as xfail for now.
2012-03-22 21:19:47 andersej: ... just to get a clean build before we go home.
2012-03-22 21:21:47 mb8g11: They failed since 225, when Gabriel pushed new stuff.
2012-03-22 21:22:20 andersej: Yes, I think he has broken the Nitsche solver.
2012-03-22 21:22:27 mb8g11: Sorry, 225 was me (repaired since), 226 was him.
2012-03-22 21:27:43 fangohr___: Anders, yes, that would be good (to mark them as xfail).
2012-03-22 21:28:17 mb8g11: I think it has to do with the Hdemagspace, it changed in that commit and that's where the error happens.
2012-03-22 21:28:40 fangohr___: Marc-Antonio, just looking at the mlab output of the devtests/oommf/compare_exchage.py file: interesting. Can we easily add a colorer to this that gives a scale for the arrows?
2012-03-22 21:29:53 fangohr___: Another point to consider when we wrap this up as test: the mayavi module is currently not installed on summer (we could change this of course) but this seem best suited for interactive display. I would thus separate the plot from the test, and maybe only show plots when the test file is run via the __name__=="__main__" mechanism or so. Probably what you were planning anyway.
2012-03-22 21:31:50 fangohr___: Oh, I see the colorers are already there in compare_anisotropy, nice. Now I just need to figure out what the two plots show ;-)
2012-03-22 21:32:13 mb8g11: Does the demagspace needs to be a FunctionSpace if the mesh is 1D? Shouldnt it still be a VectorFunctionSpace?
2012-03-22 21:34:04 mb8g11: Disregard that.
2012-03-22 21:35:07 fangohr___: OOMMF on summer (for Jenkins): should now be available and work.
2012-03-22 21:35:42 mb8g11: If it discovers oommf, then the tests will be considered automatically.
2012-03-22 21:35:58 mb8g11: py.test has a nice "skipif" feature
2012-03-22 21:36:33 mb8g11: Good idea, with the plots.
2012-03-22 21:37:39 mb8g11: Just noticed I am plotting the absolute difference. May make more sense to show the relative one. It's easier to interpret 0, 1 or worse, instead of some numbers.
2012-03-22 21:38:05 fangohr___: Yes.
2012-03-22 21:38:42 mb8g11: And a heap map may be nicer than difference vectors.. quite difficult to interpret as well.
2012-03-22 21:38:46 mb8g11: *heat map
2012-03-22 21:39:55 mb8g11: Yay Gabriel!
2012-03-22 21:41:46 fangohr___: Boy, it is busy here. Hi Gabriel ;-)
2012-03-22 21:41:47 mb8g11: Difference vectors have the advantage of showing if the error is parallel to the correct field, or deviates from it.
2012-03-22 21:41:57 fangohr___: What do you mean with 'heap map'?
2012-03-22 21:42:03 GabrielB: hi hi
2012-03-22 21:42:40 andersej: Gabriel, do you know what the problem is with the Nische solver that breaks the build?
2012-03-22 21:42:50 andersej: *Nitsche
2012-03-22 21:43:38 mb8g11: meant "heat" map, sorry. Using colors to represent the differences, instead of vectors. For instance red is a big difference, green is good or so. That would help to localise the errors (boundary or not).
2012-03-22 21:43:58 mb8g11: But it's getting late, and I'm rambling :)
2012-03-22 21:45:10 GabrielB: hey Anders I will try to run py.test
2012-03-22 21:46:16 GabrielB: I have sent around some results from Convergence testing.
2012-03-22 21:46:51 GabrielB: FK is more accurate at the moment, but GCR has the better convergence behaviour
2012-03-22 21:47:04 fangohr___: Okay, understood. Vectors are fine I guess as their colour can be assigned by length. But try spherical glyphs instead, or even a scalar field which could be visualised with isosurafces or so. I'll try to have a look at the actual data tomorrow.
2012-03-22 21:48:57 andersej: ? The FK solver isn't correct at all. I have removed the solid angle because it was implemented based on a wrong assumption.
2012-03-22 21:49:39 mb8g11: The assumption beeing you were computing something else ;)
2012-03-22 21:49:51 GabrielB: haha I like that it gets a good answer :-)
2012-03-22 21:49:54 andersej: Yes, MA. Thanks.
2012-03-22 21:50:01 mb8g11: Sorry ^^
2012-03-22 21:51:17 GabrielB: I can fix the break in Nitsche Solver. I have been trying to standardize things more in order to make comparisons easier, this is a consequence.
2012-03-22 21:51:41 andersej: Okay
2012-03-22 21:53:13 fangohr___: The plots look nice, Gabriel. But when it says error, what does it actually mean? Is 0.6 meaning that we 60% off? Or is this an absolute error? (Magnitude of m is 1?) Or should we not discuss this at all as the FK is definitely wrong (quoting Anders here)? If so, then what has happened to the GCR solver which seems even worse?
2012-03-22 21:53:40 fangohr___: Have you got the plot creation in a file somewhere? (and what mesh have you used -- netgen or dolfin-UnitSphere?)
2012-03-22 21:54:50 GabrielB: The errors are given in norms, at the moment L2 (integrate over the square of the error function) and discrete max (the maximum difference in the DOF vectors)
2012-03-22 21:55:03 GabrielB: So far I have just UnitSphere's
2012-03-22 21:55:48 GabrielB: the plot creation happens in the python file with matplotlib
2012-03-22 21:56:39 GabrielB: as for why the GCR solver is less accurate I am not sure what is going on? But with the solid angle missing from FK I am guessing the comparison is not really meaningful
2012-03-22 21:59:44 fangohr___: Okay, thanks. I shouldn't really bother you with soo many questions at night.
2012-03-22 22:00:39 andersej: Okay, good night!
2012-03-22 22:01:36 mb8g11: Good night!
2012-03-22 22:04:22 fangohr___: Good night folks.
2012-03-22 22:11:40 GabrielB: good night!
2012-03-22 22:13:16 GabrielB: ok the Nitsche solver tests should be fine now.  I am off to get some sleep good night everyone :-)
2012-03-23 09:09:27 fangohr: Good Morning Anders, DokosBot.
2012-03-23 09:23:07 andersej: Morning!
2012-03-23 12:17:09 andersej: It's pretty quiet in my office today.. Anyone else hungry?
2012-03-23 12:17:26 fangohr: Sure thing.
2012-03-23 12:17:37 fangohr: 12:30?
2012-03-23 12:17:51 andersej: Good.
2012-03-23 12:20:20 SebastianS: sounds good
2012-03-23 12:20:34 maxim|s: i'll join as well
2012-03-23 12:20:58 fangohr: I wouldn't be surprised if Marc-Antonio shows up just before lunch .... ;-)
2012-03-23 12:21:27 andersej: Hehe..
2012-03-23 14:02:33 maxim|s: Hans, can you invite me to finmag, please? I need the analytical solution for one spin.
2012-03-23 14:03:54 fangohr: what is your bitbucket username?
2012-03-23 14:04:22 maxim|s: MaximSkripnik
2012-03-23 15:00:39 fangohr: Maxim, you should have access to the finmag rpoject now.
2012-03-23 15:01:46 maxim|s: thanks
2012-03-23 15:16:32 fangohr: Maxim, go to http://summer.kk.soton.ac.uk:8080/ and create an account for you, then let me know. This should allow you to see the documentation (which is all you need), and then you don't need to compile the code and documentation from source.
2012-03-23 15:23:14 maxim|s: it says access denied
2012-03-23 15:23:40 fangohr: Does it somewhere say 'create account'?
2012-03-23 15:25:03 maxim|s: yes, I created one with username MaximSkripnik
2012-03-23 15:25:29 fangohr: Okay, let me try to activate it.
2012-03-23 15:26:03 maxim|s: i have no read permission
2012-03-23 15:31:00 fangohr: Maxim, could you try again?
2012-03-23 15:33:06 maxim|s: still no access
2012-03-23 15:40:42 maxim|s: but this is not urgent ...
2012-03-23 15:42:34 maxim|s: works now, thanks!
2012-03-23 15:42:55 fangohr: Yeah, got it just now :)
2012-03-23 15:43:02 fangohr: If you go to http://summer.kk.soton.ac.uk:8080/job/finmag/FinMag_documentation/?, you should see the latest documentation.
2012-03-23 15:43:22 fangohr: Section 3.1 is the macrospin example I mentioned.
2012-03-23 15:44:19 fangohr: The correction term (for the length of the documentation) seems to be not documented yet. Ask me (or Marc-Antonio or Anders) when you need it, and we'll find the rigth place in the source.
2012-03-23 15:44:35 maxim|s: ok, btw: the problem was in the code. i try to use these opencl vectorial data types now because the cross product is provided by the opencl library and it makes things infinitely less complicated ...
2012-03-23 15:48:59 maxim|s: i get error 404 when trying to access http://summer.kk.soton.ac.uk:8080/job/finmag/FinMag_documentation/?
2012-03-23 15:50:08 fangohr: Can you try again, please?
2012-03-23 15:51:13 maxim|s: yes, now i can see the documentation, thanks!
2012-03-23 15:56:49 mb8g11: Maxim, you can come by our office anytime.
2012-03-23 16:16:01 maxim|s: I'll visit you as soon as my problems get less trivial than they are now ;)
2012-03-23 16:28:45 andersej: Hans, do you know if py.test are run before make html on Jenkins? And is it run from the top directory?
2012-03-23 16:40:15 andersej: I guess we'll see now...
2012-03-23 22:13:56 mb8g11: who
2012-03-23 22:14:36 mb8g11: Wow, you managed to push your changesets right between my merge and me trying to push my changes as well.
2012-03-23 22:25:34 fangohr___: Hi Marc-Antonio, impressive images.
2012-03-23 22:27:09 mb8g11: Glad to hear their creation doesn't only work on my machine. I would have prefered to save .vtk files (perhaps additionally), but I don't know how to do that yet.
2012-03-23 22:27:10 fangohr___: Yeah, sorry about the timing  ;-)
2012-03-23 22:27:17 mb8g11: np ;)
2012-03-23 22:28:10 fangohr___: I think on Monday, we should have a slightly longer meeting with everybody presenting some results. Fortunately, my earlier meeting is cancelled. I'll send an email to all.
2012-03-23 22:28:57 mb8g11: Ok, I'll prepare the same for the anisotropy then.
2012-03-23 22:30:02 fangohr___: I know the filename encodes what is shown in the image. Is it also possible to display this when the interactive mlab window is displayed? This might be nice to look at the data together.
2012-03-23 22:30:48 fangohr___: Also, a colorer would be nice that shows the meaning of the colours. (No need to do it now, of course.)
2012-03-23 22:30:50 mb8g11: You mean to have the interactive windows have titles?
2012-03-23 22:31:05 fangohr___: Yes.
2012-03-23 22:31:59 mb8g11: @colours: It's a TODO. Basically, the images (especially the ones which show the difference) don't tell that much without a legend explaining the colours.
2012-03-23 22:32:32 mb8g11: @window-titles: I'll look into it.
2012-03-23 22:32:56 fangohr___: Okay, great.
2012-03-23 22:33:26 mb8g11: Quick question, I get confused by matplotlib and mayavi.mlab... Are they the same thing underneath?
2012-03-23 22:33:40 fangohr___: Hmmâ€¦.not sure. I think not.
2012-03-23 22:35:16 mb8g11: @window-titles: Yes.
2012-03-23 22:35:51 mb8g11: Ok.
2012-03-23 22:38:22 fangohr___: One more suggestion: when you work out the relative deviation of some data, you may get NaN if the true value is 0 (because you divide by zero). If this happens for a vector field for one component, then we could work around this: Imagine dx=(H2x-H1x)/H2x where H1 is the finmag solution, H2 the oommf solution and dx is the relative error. Instead of computing dx this way, we could scale the deviation relative to the total magnitude
2012-03-23 22:38:22 fangohr___: vector H2 rather than just the relevant component. So dx2 = (H2x-H1x)/||H2||. It will need a bit of care when interpreting this, but will avoid the NaNs and should be useful.
2012-03-23 22:39:04 fangohr___: (This is thought for printed data on the screen, as seen in finmag/devtests/oommf/compare_exchange.py at the moment.)
2012-03-23 22:40:02 mb8g11: Didn't think that far. Changed the 1D problem so that m0 wiggles a little in the z-component. 3D shows that problem. Will implement your suggestion.
2012-03-23 22:46:39 mb8g11: Is it difficult to save files that can be opened by mayavi?
2012-03-23 23:09:17 mb8g11: Good night!
2012-03-23 23:10:13 fangohr_____: I can only talk about Mayavi1: there you can save a .mv file (which keeps the configuration of what is seen but not the data) and a vtk file separately.
2012-03-26 12:06:48 SebastianS: anyone up for lunch sometime in the next hour or so?
2012-03-26 12:39:55 fangohr: Going for lunch now.
2012-03-26 12:40:06 SebastianS: okay i'll be up in a minute
2012-03-27 08:59:56 GabrielB: hei Anders
2012-03-27 09:00:02 andersej: Hei!
2012-03-27 09:00:51 GabrielB: Godmorgen. Har du tid til Ã¥ skype litt og prate litt om convert_mesh?
2012-03-27 09:01:13 GabrielB: eller kansje vi kan skrive hvis du vil
2012-03-27 09:01:56 GabrielB: Jeg lagd en problem fil som buker convert mesh.
2012-03-27 09:02:17 GabrielB: Og prÃ¸ve og bruke dem fra en annen fil
2012-03-27 09:02:28 GabrielB: og fÃ¥ feilmelding
2012-03-27 09:02:30 GabrielB: Using netgen to convert sphere10.geo to Gmsh2 format...
2012-03-27 09:02:30 GabrielB: NETGEN-4.9.13
2012-03-27 09:02:30 GabrielB: Developed at RWTH Aachen University, Germany
2012-03-27 09:02:30 GabrielB: and Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria
2012-03-27 09:02:30 GabrielB: Including OpenCascade geometry kernel
2012-03-27 09:02:31 GabrielB: Parsing ng.tcl

2012-03-27 09:02:37 GabrielB:  Load geometry file sphere10.geo
2012-03-27 09:02:39 GabrielB: Problem with input file:
2012-03-27 09:02:41 GabrielB: geo-file should start with 'algebraic3d'
2012-03-27 09:02:43 GabrielB: Segmentation fault
2012-03-27 09:02:45 GabrielB: netgen failed with exit code 35584
2012-03-27 09:19:03 fangohr: Hi folks, the netgen segfault seems to be 'normal' on the current Ubuntu. However, the segfault appears (at least in all use cases I have seen) only after Netgen finishes what it needs to finish. So it should work okay, despite the warning.
2012-03-27 09:23:03 andersej: Hi Hans! Yes, I think it's something to do with nvidia graphic cards on Ubuntu 11.10 or something. Gabriel's problem was a relative path, I think it's sorted now.
2012-03-27 12:27:06 andersej: Lunch?
2012-03-27 12:28:34 mb8g11: Yes.
2012-03-27 12:30:32 SebastianS: sounds good
2012-03-27 13:11:50 fangohr: Hi Gabriel, did you notice that your last commit broke the autobuild? (Not sure whether you read the email account that gets those notifications -- that's why I am asking.)
2012-03-27 13:43:15 GabrielB: How can I check the autobild locally before I send a commit?
2012-03-27 13:43:51 fangohr: If you cd into finmag/src, and then run 'py.test' (or 'py.test -v' to get nicer colours), this should tell you.
2012-03-27 13:44:22 fangohr: Jenkins runs more tests (for example for the native C++ code and building the documentation), but as you don't change those, the above should be all you need to check.
2012-03-27 13:44:36 GabrielB: ok Ill check it
2012-03-27 13:46:53 andersej: Hans, all solid angles in my case are close to zero. Is that similar to your results?
2012-03-27 13:50:31 GabrielB: I am getting this
2012-03-27 13:50:31 GabrielB: finmag/sim/tests/test_llg.py:4: in <module>

2012-03-27 13:50:38 GabrielB: and I do not know where this comes from
2012-03-27 13:50:40 GabrielB: Any help?
2012-03-27 13:52:37 fangohr: Gabriel, this is the C++ compiler saying that it can't find some boost libraries. Run the script in finmag/install/finmag-libs.sh (or similar name) which will install the required ubuntu packages.
2012-03-27 13:53:18 fangohr: Nearly right: finmag/install/on-fresh-ubuntu-11.10/finmag-libs.sh
2012-03-27 13:53:45 GabrielB: ok thanks
2012-03-27 13:54:13 fangohr: Anders, it seems to depend on the orientation. Have alook at the example committed (or rather renamed) in https://bitbucket.org/fangohr/finmag/changeset/40e348bab1f2
2012-03-27 14:00:59 GabrielB: I am writing python code to automatically generate some meshes. And would like to have them in finmag/src/mesh is this ok?
2012-03-27 14:01:26 fangohr: The code yes, the meshes no.
2012-03-27 14:01:40 GabrielB: I mean the code will do that for you locally
2012-03-27 14:01:47 fangohr: Yes, that's great.
2012-03-27 14:01:59 fangohr: Check with Anders, he has already written a tool for this.
2012-03-27 14:02:03 GabrielB: In which case I need to make sure everyone will be able to import from here locally
2012-03-27 14:02:44 fangohr: Not quite sure what you mean with 'import from here locally'? Can you give an example of code, or explain?
2012-03-27 14:03:23 GabrielB: In finmag/src/mesh there is a module marker.py. Code
2012-03-27 14:03:30 GabrielB: import marker.py
2012-03-27 14:03:54 GabrielB: #when I want to pick up the meshes I can now get the path to this folder with#
2012-03-27 14:04:25 GabrielB: os.path.dirname(marker.__file__)
2012-03-27 14:04:46 GabrielB: so that way when the meshes are picked up later on on other people's machines
2012-03-27 14:04:49 GabrielB: they will be found
2012-03-27 14:05:14 GabrielB: this will work as long as everybody can do the import
2012-03-27 14:07:14 fangohr: I think this would work if you put the marker.py into finmag/src/finmag/mesh, because then you could import it as finmag.mesh.marker. However, this sounds pretty similar to what Anders has done already. Can you check his solution first, please?
2012-03-27 14:08:10 GabrielB: ok I like your solution. I think it would be nice if everyone's meshes are put in the same place,
2012-03-27 14:08:25 GabrielB: for organisation sake
2012-03-27 14:30:14 GabrielB: Another question, if I set up the module prob_fembem_testcases.py  to automatically generate meshes will this be carried out by jenkins online?
2012-03-27 14:30:25 fangohr: Hi all, will be offline for the rest of the afternoon.
2012-03-27 14:31:26 GabrielB: Ok catch up with you later! Anyone else know by any chance?
2012-03-27 14:31:41 fangohr: Gabriel, jenkins will run 'py.test' in the finmag/src folder. So as long as you have a function 'test_generate_meshes' or so before you use them, this should work. Or you have a check before you run a test that a mesh is in place, and it it is not, you create it. Check with Anders how he has done his stuff.
2012-03-27 14:33:02 GabrielB: Anders did everything by hand. I am trying to automate this
2012-03-27 14:33:29 GabrielB: I will try to use py.test and see if it triggers any mesh generation
2012-03-27 14:33:43 fangohr: All good then, thanks. Really leaving now :)
2012-03-27 14:33:53 GabrielB: have a good one :-)
2012-03-27 14:34:08 andersej: Yes, I did something similar last Friday. It totally broke Jenkins. I just reverted to get a clean build before the weekend, and haven't gotten around to debug yet. The problem with auto mesh generation on Jenkins, is that it will take a really long time to build.
2012-03-27 14:34:25 GabrielB: yeah i want to avoid this
2012-03-27 14:34:43 GabrielB: I just want the meshes to be built by people who are interested in them
2012-03-27 14:34:47 GabrielB: and not by jenkins
2012-03-27 14:35:39 GabrielB: I got it! Jenkins will not touch the problem classes depending on the expensive to generate  meshes
2012-03-27 14:36:01 GabrielB: so the problem classes can just check themselves if they need to generate meshes
2012-03-28 09:03:26 fangohr: Good morning DokosBot.
2012-03-28 12:12:49 SebastianS: lunch anyone? ;-)
2012-03-28 12:13:03 andersej: Definitely!
2012-03-28 12:20:20 mb8g11: Yes.
2012-03-29 09:10:59 fangohr: Good Morning Anders, DoksoBot (and all the others).
2012-03-29 09:32:19 andersej: Good morning! Do you have a minute?
2012-03-29 09:32:34 fangohr: Yes, was gonna come and see you anyway.
2012-03-29 09:32:39 fangohr: Shall I come over?
2012-03-29 09:33:27 andersej: Yes, please!
2012-03-29 09:33:48 fangohr: Okay, on my way -- but need to make a coffee on the way out (2 min).
2012-03-29 09:34:23 andersej: Ok
2012-03-29 12:13:25 andersej: I'm not responsible for the build failure. It's because there's not more space on Jenkins. Dmitri is solving it now.
2012-03-29 12:13:54 fangohr: No worries :)
2012-03-29 12:26:36 fangohr: How do people feel about lunch?
2012-03-29 12:26:49 SebastianS: very enthusiastic :D
2012-03-29 12:27:01 andersej: One has to eat..
2012-03-29 12:27:24 fangohr: Fair enough. Shall we go at 12:30? :)
2012-03-29 12:27:39 andersej: 12:35.
2012-03-29 12:29:07 mb8g11: Let's say 12:34, I'm really hungry.
2012-03-29 12:29:15 fangohr: Fine by me.
2012-03-29 12:29:20 fangohr: Hurry up, Anders. :)
2012-03-29 12:29:33 andersej: I'll go when Jenkins finishes.
2012-03-29 12:30:16 andersej: Hurry up, Jenkins!
2012-03-29 14:17:10 andersej: It works..
2012-03-29 14:32:03 andersej: Where is fangohr___ ?
2012-03-29 14:32:16 mb8g11: Oh no, did he leave?
2012-03-29 14:32:32 fangohr: Folks, good to see you are having fun.
2012-03-29 14:32:46 fangohr: I have no idea what's going on.
2012-03-29 14:33:10 fangohr: I know about three logins: 2 on my Imac, one on the linux box.
2012-03-29 14:33:18 fangohr: I don't know who the other fangohr is. WHO ARE YOU?
2012-03-29 14:34:28 fangohr: For information: Colloquy upgraded to a version that didn't run on my Mac OS 10.6. I then install x-chat for Aqua, and then managed to get an old colloquy to work again. Thus the two logins. Anyway, need to think about Weiwei's equations...
2012-03-29 16:13:05 fangohr: Marc-Antonio, are you still there?
2012-03-29 16:18:02 fangohr: Okay, just gone to your office to see you.
2012-03-30 09:05:59 15SABE003: Morning all.
2012-03-30 09:06:09 15SABE003: Hans speaking here -- got a funny name today.
2012-03-30 12:44:43 15SABE003: Hi Sebastian, just to say that I am not going for lunch today (and Anders is in Oslo).
2012-03-30 13:00:04 SebastianS: okay. just went with maxim a couple of minutes ago anyway. But thanks for letting me know
2012-04-02 08:57:56 fangohr_: Good Morning DokosBot.
2012-04-02 09:58:38 mb8g11: Hello.
2012-04-02 10:03:14 maxim|s: hi
2012-04-02 10:25:45 mb8g11_: test
2012-04-02 10:32:49 maxim|s: Hans, do you think it is a good idea to adopt that SI class from nmag? I really like it.
2012-04-02 12:19:51 SebastianS: Hey Marc-Antonio, are you going for lunch? Wanna go to the shops or something like that?
2012-04-02 12:55:11 fangohr_: Maxim, yes, we could do that. However, can I encourage you to check out the Python module 'Scientific', in particular Scientific.Physics.PhysicalQuantities. I think this does the same, only slightly better ;-), and is a somewhat standard library that is easier to install.
2012-04-02 12:55:25 fangohr_: Sorry for the silence on this channel--was in meetings all morning.
2012-04-02 13:02:09 mb8g11: I'll leave IRC (connection keeps dropping) but am still reachable by e-mail.
2012-04-02 13:02:13 mb8g11: See you.
2012-04-02 16:57:19 fangohr_: over and out.
2012-04-04 00:04:29 fangohr___: DokosBot had died - -don't know why. Have restarted it. (Lives in fangohr's account on summer.kk), started via cronjob.)
2012-04-11 08:31:46 mb8g11: test
2012-04-11 08:47:32 mb8g11: Good morning Anders!
2012-04-11 08:47:51 andersej: Hello! Good morning!
2012-04-11 08:53:44 fangohr: Morning all, welcome back after the official Easter break.
2012-04-11 09:07:04 mb8g11: Good morning Hans!
2012-04-11 09:08:18 andersej: Morning Hans, same to you!
2012-04-11 09:42:15 mb8g11: test
2012-04-11 09:43:28 fangohr: Test works.
2012-04-11 09:43:34 mb8g11: Haha, thanks.
2012-04-11 11:33:04 fangohr: Around?
2012-04-11 11:33:10 fangohr: (i.e. online?)
2012-04-11 11:33:21 fangohr: Sorry, need to be more precise: Marc-Antonio, are you out there?
2012-04-11 11:37:21 mb8g11: Hiya!
2012-04-11 11:38:53 fangohr: Are you available for a short Skype session? I need to leave in 10 minutes, but that should be enough.
2012-04-11 11:39:04 mb8g11: Yes.
2012-04-11 13:56:09 fangohr: Anders, did the problem disappear we saw?
2012-04-11 13:58:01 andersej: No.
2012-04-11 13:59:31 andersej: But it's the same thing for the GCR, so it's not directly a mistake to use Weiwei's code as default. It's much faster anyway.
2012-04-11 13:59:59 fangohr: I like you optimism :)
2012-04-11 19:55:58 fangohr: Anders, are you still working on that progress bar ;-) ?
2012-04-12 09:14:38 fangohr-osiris: Good Morning Anders and Marc-Antonio
2012-04-12 09:14:45 mb8g11: Good morning!
2012-04-12 09:19:06 andersej: Morning, Hans and MA!
2012-04-12 10:07:41 mb8g11: That's strange. My computer won't let me push to bitbucket. Name or service not known. Anybody got that before here?
2012-04-12 10:08:38 andersej: I got something similar on my home computer because I didn't have the .hgrc file there.
2012-04-12 10:09:44 mb8g11: brb
2012-04-12 10:34:59 mb8g11: Was an issue with https and the new wireless router I installed yesterday. Put the old one back in for now.
2012-04-12 11:04:40 mb8g11: I'm touched a lot of files, you may consider pulling the changes before going on with your work...
2012-04-12 11:04:45 mb8g11: Sorry for that.
2012-04-12 11:58:43 fangohr: Hi, anybody interested in lunch in 20 minutes?
2012-04-12 11:58:50 andersej: Yes.
2012-04-12 12:40:30 mb8g11: Hi Gabriel!
2012-04-12 13:09:18 fangohr: Hi indeed. :)
2012-04-12 13:42:29 fangohr: Hi MA, didn't manage to track down what goes wrong in the Jacobean tests. It seems not to be as simple as changing the value of K (although that has some effect). Need to do something else for now.
2012-04-12 13:47:07 mb8g11: Thanks for having a look. Maybe I can spot it :)
2012-04-12 13:47:35 fangohr: Ta.
2012-04-12 15:33:46 andersej: Hi all, I want to run netgen in a makefile to create nmag compatible mesh. Is there something I can do to avoid that it aborts after the "standard" netgen error?
2012-04-12 16:01:41 mb8g11: yes
2012-04-12 16:01:48 andersej: Good.
2012-04-12 16:01:52 mb8g11: prepend the command with a -
2012-04-12 16:05:47 andersej: Great! Thanks!
2012-04-12 16:17:57 mb8g11: no problem.
2012-04-12 16:18:07 fangohr: Anders, any news on the nmag2 problem? (Just checking as I now explain this to Weiwei.)
2012-04-12 16:18:12 mb8g11: So you guys are sure the exchange is too weak, and not the demag too strong?
2012-04-12 16:19:57 fangohr: The comparison plot with the Nmag/OOMMF data should tell us this. Have you done that already?
2012-04-12 16:24:01 mb8g11: It's the first thing I did, but I didn't notice any changes... do I have to enable this somewhere?
2012-04-12 16:24:53 mb8g11: Aaah, you changed A in one of your tests. Didn't catch that :)
2012-04-12 16:44:12 mb8g11: How very, very weird.
2012-04-12 16:46:54 fangohr: I think Weiwei and I figured out why the nmag2 example fails. I'll try to write it down somewhere in a moment.
2012-04-12 16:46:56 mb8g11: Do you mind if I copy the nmag example into that directory? Should make comparing easier.
2012-04-12 16:47:09 mb8g11: I'll write the stuff that adds it to the plot as well.
2012-04-12 16:47:40 fangohr__: Do you talk to me, MA?
2012-04-12 16:50:14 mb8g11: To whoever is working on that example thingie.
2012-04-12 16:51:28 fangohr__: We should add the *geo file(s), a makefile to produce the netgen and nmag mesh, and -- exceptionally -- a file that keeps time, mx, my, mz results of nmag so we don't need to run nmag again and again (takes 30 seconds or so). Anders should have all the files and the data file as well.
2012-04-12 16:51:30 fangohr__: Anders, still there?
2012-04-12 16:51:32 fangohr__: ;-)
2012-04-12 16:53:19 mb8g11: Exactly what I planned to do - like with the other nmag comparisons in src/finmag/tests/nmag
2012-04-12 16:53:48 fangohr: Okay, great. I have put the relevant files in /tmp/example2 on osiris.sesnet for Anders to nick, but of course you can get them as well.
2012-04-12 16:54:21 mb8g11: Sorry, what relevant files?
2012-04-12 16:55:05 fangohr: Just the nmag source files.
2012-04-12 16:55:16 fangohr: (in case you don't have them already.)
2012-04-12 16:55:16 mb8g11: Ah... I was copying them from the manual.
2012-04-12 16:55:37 fangohr: yes, the new manual is hiding mostfiles (such as makefile etc) which is a bit annoying.
2012-04-12 16:56:08 mb8g11: I'll copy them from the existing tests.
2012-04-12 17:09:30 fangohr: over and out from me. Back tomorrow morning.
2012-04-12 17:09:59 mb8g11: See you!
2012-04-12 17:10:39 fangohr: BTW, created a new story to explain how to fix the nmag2 example probelm. https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/27923227
2012-04-12 17:11:00 mb8g11: Great. I'll push the comparison in a few minutes, it already compares, just need the plot.
2012-04-12 17:13:20 andersej: I'm sorry, was occupied with the testing..
2012-04-12 17:13:29 andersej: I'm finished now.
2012-04-12 17:13:49 andersej: I'll push in a minute..
2012-04-12 17:16:43 andersej: Okay, I see you did it already, hehe..
2012-04-12 17:16:54 mb8g11: Okay, I just pushed the corresponding nmag code as well as a comparison and a comparative plot... that may be what you were working on...
2012-04-12 17:18:05 mb8g11: and of course I failed the merge.
2012-04-12 17:23:55 andersej: Marc Antonio, what are you working on now? I will try not to work on the same files, hehe.
2012-04-12 17:28:25 mb8g11: I'm working on the anisotropy, just did this because it got me curious and I thought it was safe to do.
2012-04-12 17:28:41 mb8g11: Had I known you were working on it, I would have let you do your thing.
2012-04-12 17:29:45 mb8g11: So.... is it just me, or does the "fix" not fix the problem?
2012-04-12 17:30:05 andersej: Ok, I'll just merge in some of the differences between our codes if you aren't working anymore on the nmag example.
2012-04-12 17:30:16 mb8g11: Okay.
2012-04-12 17:30:22 andersej: Which fix?
2012-04-12 17:32:08 mb8g11: Multiplying the exchange with 1e18.
2012-04-12 17:33:17 andersej: It seems to work pretty good. What are you thinking about?
2012-04-12 17:34:52 mb8g11: It does indeed, I didn't see we were saving m*Ms for the finmag data.
2012-04-12 17:36:06 mb8g11: Just fixing my plot and then I'll let you work in peace :)
2012-04-12 17:36:24 andersej: Okay :)
2012-04-12 17:39:18 mb8g11: Done. It's all yours.
2012-04-12 17:48:58 andersej: Well, it appears that we have done almost exactly the same.. I could just go home, but it's a thunderstorm outside.
2012-04-12 18:10:50 andersej: Seems quiet now, I'll try to go home. Over and out!
2012-04-13 08:20:35 andersej: Good morning!
2012-04-13 09:03:36 fangohr: Good morning, all.
2012-04-13 09:08:43 andersej: Morning, Hans!
2012-04-13 09:12:45 mb8g11: Good morning!
2012-04-13 09:13:00 andersej: Good morning, Marc Antonio!
2012-04-13 09:35:28 andersej: I have cloned new repositories on both my own machine and osiris, but still I get different values in averages.txt from exchange_demag. Is there a logical explanation to this?
2012-04-13 09:44:36 andersej: What results do you get, by the way? On time 1e-10, my x-component is -0.01086 on osiris and -0.01104 on aleph0.
2012-04-13 09:54:20 mb8g11: I love the progressbars, btw.
2012-04-13 09:54:28 andersej: Hehe..
2012-04-13 09:54:59 fangohr: Me too.
2012-04-13 09:55:28 mb8g11: -0.0108648697522
2012-04-13 09:56:33 andersej: Exactly the same as I get on osiris. Why don't I get it here as well?
2012-04-13 09:57:24 fangohr: Different dolfin version (buggy trunk?)
2012-04-13 09:57:59 andersej: No, I have installed the stable build.
2012-04-13 09:57:59 mb8g11: first batch of intel sandy bridge processors (buggy cpu?) ;)
2012-04-13 09:59:00 andersej: That doesn't sound good..
2012-04-13 10:04:12 mb8g11: It was meant to be a joke :-/
2012-04-13 10:11:42 andersej: Hehe.. I have to revisit this later, I'm trying to understand Weiwei's code.
2012-04-13 10:44:44 mb8g11: Wow. My nmag anisotropy fields has non-zero components in all directions. My finmag anisotropy only has a non-zero z-component.
2012-04-13 10:45:50 mb8g11: $ python finmag/src/finmag/tests/nmag/anisotropy_1d/test_nmag_1d_anisotropy.py
2012-04-13 10:45:58 fangohr: Ah, that's nothing to worry about. Nmag is making things unnecessarily complicated. The reason for this is that the term that enters the LLG is H cross M. In the process, only the components of H that are perpendicular to M survive.
2012-04-13 10:46:16 fangohr: So this is fine as long as we do not do LLB physics or use the Baryakhter term for damping.
2012-04-13 10:47:24 fangohr: If it is easily done, you could compare M cross H (or H cross M) for every node. This should give better agreement. Having said that, if the agreement between finmag and magpar is good, then I am happy to keep the odd nmag results with a short note (based on my comments above).
2012-04-13 10:52:51 mb8g11: I'm nearly there, might as well go the whole way.
2012-04-13 11:24:10 andersej: Hello, Sebastian!
2012-04-13 11:24:19 mb8g11: Nice, it works, thanks Hans!
2012-04-13 11:24:21 SebastianS: good morning ;-)
2012-04-13 11:38:43 fangohr: Good Morning Sebastian. :)
2012-04-13 12:07:25 mb8g11: Anyone working on the scaling factor for the mesh coordinates?
2012-04-13 12:07:41 fangohr: No.
2012-04-13 12:07:54 fangohr: I'd love to do this, but I shouldn't ...
2012-04-13 12:09:14 mb8g11: You have a good reason not to, now... just grabbed the task on pivotal tracker :)
2012-04-13 12:11:49 fangohr: Great.
2012-04-13 12:11:55 fangohr: Just added the following idea to the story: Had another thought about this though: we should maybe save the attribute that carries the scaling factor in the dolfin mesh class object (!). Maybe call it something like .finmag_cscale for FINMAG CoordinateSCALE, say. It is a bit risky to just add an attribute to a class (as the dolfin folks may want to use that attribute in the future) but prepending it with 'finmag' should reduce that risk significantly.
2012-04-13 12:11:55 fangohr: plus side is that the scale information is available everywhere (I hope?) where we have (direct) access to the mesh object but may not have access to the LLG class. So this would reduce the number of parameters we need to pass, for example, to the exchange object.
2012-04-13 12:19:10 andersej: I'm in desperat need for some food now.
2012-04-13 12:19:38 fangohr: Okay, then, I give in. I'll pick you up in 3 minutes. Sebastian, are you joining us as well?
2012-04-13 12:19:45 fangohr: What about Dokosbot?
2012-04-13 12:23:15 SebastianS: jep
2012-04-13 12:23:18 SebastianS: on my way
2012-04-13 13:46:37 mb8g11: Lunch, see you later.
2012-04-13 16:16:56 fangohr: Over and out for some hours.
2012-04-16 09:04:05 fangohr: Good Morning, Anders.
2012-04-16 09:04:25 andersej: Good morning, Hans! Had a nice weekend?
2012-04-16 09:04:46 fangohr: Yes, thank you. Yourself?
2012-04-16 09:05:39 andersej: Yes.
2012-04-16 10:18:16 fangohr: Good Morning Neil :)
2012-04-16 10:18:26 fangohr: Nice to see you here.
2012-04-16 10:18:46 nsob: Morning :)
2012-04-16 10:30:44 fangohr: Hi Marc-Antonio.
2012-04-16 10:31:21 fangohr: Just to introduce nsob: he is Neil O'Brien and will help us a little with some aspects of finmag and the DYNAMAG project.
2012-04-16 10:31:32 fangohr: (I am in a meeting now until 11:40 or so).
2012-04-16 11:50:05 fangohr: Hi folks. My office has been vacated now, so we can start.
2012-04-17 09:13:59 andersej: So, you beat me today, Hans.. And so did the entire "cage". Not good..
2012-04-17 09:16:55 fangohr: Good morning Anders, Neil, DokosBot.
2012-04-17 09:24:09 andersej: Good morning all!
2012-04-17 11:03:17 andersej: Hans, do you have a minute?
2012-04-17 11:08:11 andersej: Or perhaps just explain here.. I don't completely understand what you mean with the regression test in the nmag2 example? Do you want to refine the mesh or use smaller time steps, or perhaps something else?
2012-04-17 12:50:46 fangohr: (answer given over lunch ;-))
2012-04-18 08:51:46 fangohr: Good morning DokosBot.
2012-04-18 11:57:08 fangohr: Hi all, I am skipping lunch today.
2012-04-18 12:02:28 maxim|s: Hello. Is somebody else going to have lunch at staff club?
2012-04-18 12:05:43 andersej: Yes, I want to.
2012-04-18 12:07:05 andersej: When do you want to go?
2012-04-18 12:07:56 maxim|s: I'll come to your room at 12:30
2012-04-18 12:08:29 andersej: Great!
2012-04-18 13:42:27 maxim|s: Hans, are you available for a talk right now?
2012-04-18 13:42:53 fangohr: On the phone right now. How about 14:15?
2012-04-18 13:43:24 maxim|s: ok, see you at 14:15
2012-04-19 09:52:35 nsob104: Morning :)
2012-04-19 09:53:43 andersej: Good morning, Neil!
2012-04-19 11:25:51 fangohr: Morning Neil, Anders, Sebastian. I am stuck in all sorts of meetings today.
2012-04-19 11:26:24 SebastianS: but ours in 5 min is still on, isn't it?
2012-04-19 11:26:34 fangohr: Oh yes, that's one of them. :)
2012-04-19 11:26:51 SebastianS: okay ;-) thanks
2012-04-19 11:28:22 fangohr: Neil, would you by chance be available this afternoon between 15 and 16? Don't worry if not ; just checking.
2012-04-19 13:52:38 nsob104: Hi Hans, sorry for the delay (was taking my driving test), I'll be able to make the meeting at 15:00
2012-04-19 13:53:13 fangohr: Great, see you then.
2012-04-20 09:05:44 fangohr: Morning Anders.
2012-04-20 09:05:51 andersej: Good morning!
2012-04-20 12:27:24 andersej: Hi, Maxim! Hans and I are going for lunch in ten minutes. Do you want to join?
2012-04-20 13:16:53 andersej: So, DokosBot.. Looks like it's only you and me now.
2012-04-20 17:11:33 fangohr_: Over and out for today.
2012-04-23 15:49:12 mb8g11: Cake?
2012-04-23 16:13:45 fangohr_: Hi MA, visitors say thank you for cake. They wander is there Banana in there?
2012-04-23 16:58:53 mb8g11: Yes, there is. 3 of them :)
2012-04-24 09:09:23 fangohr_: Good Morning Anders, DokosBot.
2012-04-24 09:09:33 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-04-24 10:09:09 andersej: Hans... I have no idea why I can't run nmeshimport on jenkins via python's commands.getstatusoutput when it runs flawless in every makefile we have.
2012-04-24 11:55:42 fangohr_: Marc-Antonio, are you in the office?
2012-04-24 11:55:47 fangohr_: Good morning, by the way.
2012-04-24 11:56:08 mb8g11: Hi, yes!
2012-04-24 11:56:33 fangohr_: Do you mind coming around to my office? We need your help :)
2012-04-24 12:37:36 mb8g11: Haba haba?
2012-04-24 12:39:16 fangohr_: Yes, absotutely.
2012-04-24 13:27:43 mb8g11: Had the documentation built correctly on jenkins in the last few days?
2012-04-24 13:28:12 fangohr_: Yesterday, yes.
2012-04-24 13:28:41 fangohr_: But it may fail because it can't find nmag and needs that for the documentation. (Not sure exactly what Anders was working on.)
2012-04-24 13:29:02 fangohr_: Am hoping that the current build (http://summer.kk.soton.ac.uk:8080/job/finmag/456/console) will pass.
2012-04-24 13:31:26 fangohr_: wohoo. Looking good, but still running.
2012-04-24 13:33:11 fangohr_: Hm, failed. But not due to Nmag missing -- that is now working I think.
2012-04-24 13:34:02 fangohr_: I think I'll hand this over to Anders at this point.
2012-04-24 13:46:00 fangohr_: Okay, couldn't resist. Have done another change that might fix this.
2012-04-24 13:54:47 fangohr_: Phew. Compiled fine now.
2012-04-24 13:55:10 mb8g11: Good intuition there... but how comes this needs to be set again? Isn't this variable in the environment?
2012-04-24 13:55:43 andersej: Okay, I'm back in the office now. Thanks for fixing it.
2012-04-24 13:56:51 fangohr_: I don't know how the make file is called -- I am guessing from inside a python script. The PYTHONPATH is not set in the jenkins enviroment, but instead jenkins knows what it is, and will pass it via "PYTHONPATH=XXX python something.py" to the execution. If that something.py then internally executes a shell command to call 'make', it will have lost that PYTHONPATH.
2012-04-24 13:56:57 fangohr_: That's my best guess.
2012-04-24 13:57:33 fangohr_: Will try to do some teaching preparations now, but keep me posted if you need any input etc.
2012-04-24 15:42:52 mb8g11: reboot, problem with the graphic drivers
2012-04-24 18:20:30 andersej: To Marc-Antonio: /src/finmag/demag/solver_fk.py
2012-04-25 08:55:36 fangohr_: Good Morning DokosBot.
2012-04-25 11:50:05 mb8g11: I won't be going to lunch today, have a PGR meeting.
2012-04-25 11:50:24 fangohr_: Me neither -- doing sports.
2012-04-25 12:06:14 andersej: Are you sure about the PGR meeting?
2012-04-25 12:06:48 mb8g11: Haha, funny. Yes. 25/04/2012 12:00 Building 5/2017. And yet... nobody there.
2012-04-25 12:20:23 mb8g11: Gotta love this faculty.
2012-04-25 12:21:04 andersej: Hans, are you sure you gave me the right function?  ncol bar E_exch_Py E_demag_Py gives completely different results than ours.
2012-04-25 12:21:41 andersej: Or was this with dividing on volume? Will try..
2012-04-25 12:22:28 maxim|s: Hi all, is anybody going to have lunch soon?
2012-04-25 12:23:08 andersej: Yes, Marc-Antonio and I will go in about ten minutes? Do you want to join?
2012-04-25 12:23:30 maxim|s: yes, see you at 12:30
2012-04-25 12:38:30 andersej: I will fix the jenkins build after lunch..
2012-04-25 13:44:21 andersej: Hello, Weiwei!
2012-04-25 13:44:45 ww1g11_: hello
2012-04-25 13:44:53 fangohr_: Hi Weiwei, good to see you. ;)
2012-04-25 13:45:26 ww1g11: good to see you
2012-04-25 14:23:22 andersej: Dividing by a scalar, the exchange and demag energies are very similar to the corresponding energies from nmag. The problem is that I can't explain the scalar factor.
2012-04-25 14:23:43 fangohr_: Which program do I need to run to see the plot?
2012-04-25 14:24:09 andersej: examples/exchange_demag/test_exchange_demag.py
2012-04-25 16:03:46 mb8g11: Anders, this is your story: #28605277 https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/28605277
2012-04-25 16:03:49 mb8g11: :D
2012-04-25 16:09:43 andersej: Thanks!
2012-04-26 09:31:10 fangohr_: Good Morning Anders and DokosBot.
2012-04-26 09:31:18 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-04-26 11:45:48 fangohr_: Morning folks. I need to interview today at 12:00. I guess you go ahead and have lunch without me.
2012-04-26 11:46:59 andersej: Okay, have fun!
2012-04-26 17:14:59 fangohr_: Over and out.
2012-04-27 13:23:41 andersej: Hi, DokosBot! Do you want to join for lunch?
2012-04-27 15:19:14 andersej: Over and out! Have a nice weekend, DokosBot!
2012-05-01 09:16:27 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-05-01 09:16:31 fangohr_: Good morning Anders, DokosBot.
2012-05-01 10:11:32 andersej: Hans, can you notify me when your visitor has left? I have a problem.
2012-05-01 10:24:34 andersej: replace("can you ", "could you please") - I can see myself that the line was quite "Norwegian", hehe..
2012-05-01 10:51:22 fangohr_: No worries. I am available now.
2012-05-01 12:14:09 SebastianS: someone going for lunch anytime soon?^^
2012-05-01 12:15:03 andersej: Yes, I think so. Just come over, we are ready in a moment.
2012-05-01 12:17:16 SebastianS: kk
2012-05-01 12:17:20 SebastianS: on my way
2012-05-01 14:01:52 fangohr: Anders, this looks good.
2012-05-01 14:02:01 fangohr: (exchange energy density).
2012-05-01 14:02:24 fangohr: The disagreement with Nmag could have two reasons: (i) coarseness of the mesh, (ii) inappropriate simplicifications in Nmag. Or (iii) something else.
2012-05-01 14:02:31 fangohr: Could you run this again with a finer mesh?
2012-05-01 14:03:01 fangohr: The other useful comparison would be with OOMMF.
2012-05-01 14:07:10 andersej: Yes, I'll do it!
2012-05-01 14:10:26 fangohr: I am not sure whether OOMMF provides energy densities in a spatially resolved way, but I would guess it does. I think Nmag might be a bit sloppy in how it computes the volume of the base functions, and this might affect the results exactly as we see them. I trust OOMMF in this respect.
2012-05-01 14:32:58 mb8g11: http://github.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/tips.html
2012-05-01 14:52:17 SebastianS: hans, do you have a minute? I have two question regarding the temperature gradient paper.
2012-05-01 15:07:51 fangohr_: Hi Sebastian, no, sorry, fully booked this afternoon. Can you try to find the answer yourself? If you are stuck for longer than today, feel free to put questions in email and I will see what I can do.
2012-05-01 15:16:12 SebastianS: okay thanks. I'll see if I can work something out myself
2012-05-01 17:34:20 mb8g11: Dmitri was here to pick up the book... Nice of him to not come this morning, he definitely looked contagious.
2012-05-02 11:00:09 andersej: Hello, Neil.
2012-05-02 11:00:28 nsob104: Hi Anders, Hans, DokosBot.
2012-05-02 12:03:46 fangohr: @Anders: In tests/tests_dmi_terms:  test_dmi_with_analytical_solution():
2012-05-02 12:05:06 fangohr: Iridis documentation: start from http://cmg.soton.ac.uk/iridis
2012-05-02 12:07:53 fangohr: Request software on https://cmg.soton.ac.uk/community/projects/iridis/boards/show/12
2012-05-02 16:28:25 fangohr_: Marc-Antonio, yes, I forgot to update /etc/shadow. Can you try to login to osiris again, please?
2012-05-02 16:28:49 fangohr_: Anders, same story here. My mistake.
2012-05-02 16:29:17 andersej: Yes, just sent you the email, hehe..
2012-05-02 16:29:58 fangohr_: I see it works for anders now.
2012-05-02 16:30:30 andersej: Yes. sudo apt-get install vim-gnome, please.
2012-05-02 16:31:10 fangohr_: I thought you might say something like this.
2012-05-02 16:31:35 fangohr_: Done. Anything else?
2012-05-02 16:32:01 andersej: Thanks! Not for my part, no..
2012-05-02 16:33:12 mb8g11: vim is good.
2012-05-02 16:33:29 mb8g11: Thank you, all is good :)
2012-05-02 16:38:52 mb8g11: However, summer might be running out of diskspace.
2012-05-02 16:39:51 fangohr_: I have noticed. I have made some space, and am in the process of freeing up another 8GB. That should sort us out for some time.
2012-05-02 16:47:59 andersej: Hans, the DMI class is not ideally constructed wrt computing energy densities, as it computes the energy in different functions depending on mesh dimension. Am I allowed to do small modifications to these functions?
2012-05-02 16:48:13 fangohr_: Yes, please do fix this :)
2012-05-02 17:17:17 fangohr_: Over and out for today.
2012-05-03 11:36:20 MaximS: Hi all! Hans, can I ask you something?
2012-05-03 11:36:51 fangohr_: Hi, sure.
2012-05-03 11:37:00 fangohr_: (Lucky, I just returned to the office ;-))
2012-05-03 11:41:18 MaximS: I have to calculate the distance between two spins for the dipole-dipole-interaction. This is not a problem for non-periodic boundaries. But what should I do if I have periodic boundaries?
2012-05-03 11:42:08 MaximS: E.g. if you assume two spins in the opposite corners, their distance is not only the diagonal but also a very short connection because they are neighbours as well.
2012-05-03 11:56:54 MaximS: Another possibility would be to define a radius for the dipole-dipole-interaction and take all spins inside a sphere with this radius around a particular spin in to account. Just like it's done for the exchange coupling where the sphere contains only the nearest neighbours.
2012-05-03 12:25:15 andersej: Someone up for lunch?
2012-05-03 12:29:35 MaximS: Not today.
2012-05-03 12:30:24 andersej: mb8g11, how about you? SebastianS?
2012-05-03 12:30:47 SebastianS: just came online and missed you conversation; what are you asking me?^^
2012-05-03 12:31:00 andersej: Lunch in 5?
2012-05-03 12:31:17 SebastianS: ah no sorry; i'm not in the uni right now
2012-05-03 12:31:39 SebastianS: thanks for asking, though ;-)
2012-05-03 12:31:50 andersej: Sure, okay..
2012-05-03 12:32:47 mb8g11: In 5.
2012-05-03 14:41:05 mb8g11: Hans, / on summer is full. I told Jenkins to only store the build of the last 14 days but I don't know when it will start deleting the old ones.
2012-05-03 14:41:25 mb8g11: What can we do to get some free space?
2012-05-03 14:41:32 fangohr_: Good point, thanks. let me continue the data clearing I started yesterday.
2012-05-03 14:45:04 mb8g11: No worries though, we know you're busy today.
2012-05-03 14:59:06 fangohr_: Hi MA, I have freed 3GB.
2012-05-03 14:59:21 fangohr_: I have also freed 0.8 GB yesterday (I think), but that seems to have been eaten by today.
2012-05-03 14:59:28 fangohr_: So something is very disk space hungry on the system.
2012-05-03 14:59:38 fangohr_: Have you got root access to summer?
2012-05-03 15:02:54 mb8g11: By default Jenkins stores every new build, ever. That must be space-hungry.
2012-05-03 15:03:16 mb8g11: Limiting that storage to 14 days should keep it in check.
2012-05-03 15:03:19 mb8g11: No root access.
2012-05-03 15:06:33 fangohr_: Does it actually store the object files and temporary data etc? That is a lot!
2012-05-03 15:06:49 fangohr_: Have you set this to 14 days already? So it should kickin soon?
2012-05-03 15:06:52 andersej: Hi Hans and MA.. Regarding the lunch discussion: I noticed that it wasn't a minus sign mistake. It was a minus one mistake (of course my numbers were 0.5 and -0.5 and my K=1...). When I removed the K*1 part of the anisotropy energy I get the same as nmag. Removing this is of course no problem when computing the field, because it vanishes in the dE/dM part anyway. But when computing energy / energy density, we will have a one K  too low result. I h
2012-05-03 15:06:52 andersej: umbly claim that this may be a bug in nmag.
2012-05-03 15:12:59 fangohr_: I would say it is a matter of convention ;-)
2012-05-03 15:13:09 fangohr_: What does OOMMF say on the matter?
2012-05-03 15:14:08 fangohr_: We wrote an extension to OMMF some time ago, which is following the Nmag way (see http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/software/oxs_uniaxial4.html), but maybe that is too biased. It computes a particular uniaxial anisotropy.
2012-05-03 16:00:58 mb8g11: I don't know what oommf says, but magpar sides with Anders on this one.
2012-05-03 16:01:07 mb8g11: ;0
2012-05-03 16:11:49 andersej: Yes!
2012-05-03 16:12:19 mb8g11: Well, it's still only a 1 :)
2012-05-03 16:21:01 andersej: Well, I would be happy with only 1 girlfriend : )
2012-05-03 16:35:18 mb8g11: Your girlfriend is like a real number... except her real part is 0.
2012-05-03 16:35:46 mb8g11: *complex number. dammit. ruined it.
2012-05-03 16:39:25 andersej: Haha! When we are already into math/programming humour: http://folk.uio.no/larsstor/
2012-05-03 16:39:44 andersej: No. Sorry..
2012-05-03 16:40:11 andersej: http://folk.uio.no/larsstor/motivationals/godisrealunlessint.jpeg
2012-05-03 16:48:14 mb8g11: Have fun merging btw.
2012-05-03 16:51:35 andersej: Let's see who breaks Jenkins first.
2012-05-04 09:18:57 fangohr_: Good morning, DokosBot. Fancy a coffee?
2012-05-04 09:20:47 nsob104: Morning Hans
2012-05-04 09:21:46 fangohr_: Morning Neil.
2012-05-04 09:21:51 fangohr_: I'll look into permissions now.
2012-05-04 09:23:44 fangohr_: Do you have the path to the repository handy?
2012-05-04 09:23:48 fangohr_: (on eta)
2012-05-04 09:24:46 nsob104: ssh://eta.kk.soton.ac.uk//home/hg/dynamag/talks/2012-05-15-36month-Ferrara is where I cloned from
2012-05-04 09:25:23 nsob104: and I am in the group 'dynamag' on there
2012-05-04 09:25:29 nsob104: Hi, Anders
2012-05-04 09:25:55 fangohr_: Neil, can you try to push again, please?
2012-05-04 09:26:02 fangohr_: (Have given the group more rights.)
2012-05-04 09:26:07 fangohr_: Morning Anders.
2012-05-04 09:27:45 nsob104: Hans, it worked, thanks.  I'll head over once I have some coffee.
2012-05-04 09:27:53 fangohr_: Okay, good. Thank you.
2012-05-04 09:36:15 andersej: Hello, good morning to all three of you
2012-05-04 12:21:02 SebastianS: anyone going for lunch in the next hour or so?
2012-05-04 12:23:48 andersej: Yes! Ten minutes from now! Dmitri's also in.
2012-05-04 12:24:21 SebastianS: okay
2012-05-04 12:24:30 SebastianS: i'll come by your office then, as usual!
2012-05-04 13:36:10 fangohr_: Hi folks, sandwhichs outside my office for collection if you are interested.
2012-05-04 15:40:04 andersej: Hans, still there?
2012-05-04 15:47:39 fangohr_: Hi Anders, yes I am.
2012-05-04 15:47:58 andersej: May I ask you one thing in five minutes from now?
2012-05-04 15:48:06 fangohr_: Sure.
2012-05-04 17:02:22 fangohr_: Over and out -- see you in two weeks :)
2012-05-04 18:01:07 andersej: Yes, see you! Have a nice time!
2012-05-04 18:43:46 andersej: Okay DokosBot, I'm leaving now. Have a nice weekend, see you next week!
2012-05-08 12:12:32 SebastianS: Hey Anders, are you in the office? Or am I the only one up for lunch?^^
2012-05-08 12:15:02 andersej: No, I'm in as well!
2012-05-08 12:16:06 andersej: When do you want to go?
2012-05-08 12:17:24 SebastianS: ah awesome! I really don't mind actually. You name it!
2012-05-08 12:17:34 andersej: As soon as possible!
2012-05-08 12:17:56 SebastianS: right :D just finishing something here. Say at 12.30?
2012-05-08 12:18:18 andersej: Yes, I'll come by your office this time!
2012-05-08 12:18:26 SebastianS: ah okay see you then
2012-05-08 14:47:22 mb8g11: Hi all.
2012-05-08 14:49:14 SebastianS: hey ;-)
2012-05-09 08:26:51 gaba__: Hihi
2012-05-09 12:39:30 mb8g11: Hm.
2012-05-11 09:08:05 fangohr: Good Morning, DokosBot.
2012-05-11 11:01:59 SebastianS: hans, as the anisotropy is not implemented yet, I have some time at my hands. I remembered you suggested to put together a documentation for the simlib code using Sphinx and I was wondering if I should start with that. Do you still think this would be a good idea?
2012-05-14 14:44:53 gabrielbalaban: Hi Anders,
2012-05-14 14:48:57 andersej: Hello!
2012-05-14 14:57:55 gabrielbalaban: Jobber du tilfeldigvis med FK solveren? Jeg har tenkt Ã¥ jobbe med den litt, men jeg kan godt vente med det.
2012-05-14 14:58:47 andersej: Nei, skal gjoere noe annet naa, bare sett i gang.
2012-05-14 15:01:01 gabrielbalaban: ok kult! Jeg skal jobbe omtrent en time med FKsolveren.
2012-05-15 17:15:37 fangohr_laptop: Hello DokosBot and Marc Antonio :)
2012-05-15 17:23:38 mb8g11: Hans, hi!
2012-05-15 17:23:57 mb8g11: All well in Italy?
2012-05-15 17:24:49 fangohr_laptop: Hi -- yes, thank you. A brief break here, so I do some email and stuff before continuing at 20:00 local time with evening programme.
2012-05-15 17:25:06 mb8g11: Cool.
2012-05-15 17:25:06 fangohr_laptop: How are things in Southampton?
2012-05-15 17:26:09 mb8g11: Good good. Anders just left to finally get light bulbs for his dark flat, I'm doing some reading for my report and have just installed Ubuntu 12.04
2012-05-15 17:26:54 mb8g11: (clean install)
2012-05-15 17:27:06 fangohr_laptop: Nice.
2012-05-15 17:27:23 mb8g11: Counting on you to bring fresh ideas back ;)
2012-05-16 10:16:30 gabrielbalaban: Hei Anders!
2012-05-16 10:16:36 andersej: Hei!
2012-05-16 10:16:55 gabrielbalaban: GÃ¥r det bra?
2012-05-16 10:17:16 andersej: Ja, ganske. Enn du?
2012-05-16 10:18:16 gabrielbalaban: ja ogsÃ¥ ganske, jeg glede meg til i morn (17 mai!) og jobbe litt med finmag. Jeg har ut  df.KrylovSolver slik som du bruker i FK
2012-05-16 10:18:28 gabrielbalaban: og lurer pÃ¥ om du vet hvordan man kan sette toleransen?
2012-05-16 10:20:19 gabrielbalaban: I en Unit Test til Dimitri fÃ¥r jeg en L2 feil av stÃ¸rrelse 0.0107519, selv om krylov toleransen er antaglivis omternt 10x -7!
2012-05-16 10:24:50 gabrielbalaban: se her http://fenicsproject.org/pub/femcenter/pub/software/dolfin/doc/KrylovSolver_8h-source.html
2012-05-16 10:25:05 gabrielbalaban: Jeg tror TOL er privat owwwww!
2012-05-16 10:26:46 andersej: Jeg ville tippet at dette kunne endres ved solver.parameters["absolute_tolerance"] = ... eller noe i den stilen.
2012-05-16 10:30:27 gabrielbalaban: hmm god ide!
2012-05-16 10:31:40 andersej: >>> from dolfin import *
2012-05-16 10:31:41 andersej: >>> s = KrylovSolver()
2012-05-16 10:31:41 andersej: >>> print s.parameters["absolute_tolerance"]
2012-05-16 10:31:41 andersej: 1e-15
2012-05-16 10:41:03 gabrielbalaban: takk!
2012-05-16 10:43:20 gabrielbalaban: hmm selv om toleransen er 1e-15 sÃ¥ for jeg en feil av orden -11
2012-05-16 10:45:40 gabrielbalaban: FYI dette hjelper self.phia_solver.parameters["relative_tolerance"] = df.e-12
2012-05-16 10:46:07 andersej: Fint!
2012-05-16 13:13:32 andersej: http://sn0v.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/installing-cuda-on-ubuntu-12-04/
2012-05-16 13:19:12 mb8g11: thanks
2012-05-16 15:16:39 mb8g11: soon it will have compiled, Anders
2012-05-16 15:18:34 andersej: That's when the debugging starts..
2012-05-16 15:21:08 mb8g11: Just remind me, why am I doing this?
2012-05-16 15:21:42 andersej: To use the gpu-solver.
2012-05-16 15:27:26 mb8g11: ... and? :D
2012-05-16 15:31:06 andersej: That's a funny thing to do.
2012-05-16 16:06:35 mb8g11: Yeah, as funny as new ubuntu versions.
2012-05-17 10:25:41 andersej: Heey! Welcome back!
2012-05-17 10:25:50 fangohr: Good Morning, Anders and DokosBot.
2012-05-17 10:26:19 andersej: Good morning! How was Italy?
2012-05-17 10:27:01 fangohr: Mostly warm, not enough sight seeing. Nice coffee.
2012-05-17 12:24:07 fangohr: Hi Marc-Antonio, ready for a biscuit?
2012-05-17 16:33:47 nsob104:  /?
2012-05-18 15:17:09 mb8g11: /usr/local/cuda/bin
2012-05-21 00:14:13 fangohr_laptop: Hello DokosBot.
2012-05-23 13:02:21 MaximS: Hi Anders.
2012-05-23 13:23:31 andersej: Hi! Sorry late answer, just been out buying food.
2012-05-23 13:25:05 MaximS: I could pick you up in 15 Minutes and we'll go to my office.
2012-05-23 13:25:23 andersej: Sounds good! See you then!
2012-05-23 13:25:29 MaximS: See you
2012-05-23 17:41:54 fangohr: Good afternoon, Anders and DokosBot.
2012-05-23 17:42:14 andersej: Hello, Hans!
2012-05-23 17:42:19 fangohr: :)
2012-05-23 17:42:54 fangohr: I have been told it is hot in Southampton?
2012-05-23 17:43:35 andersej: I can confirm this. Not many people in the building..
2012-05-23 17:43:53 fangohr: :) â€” have you got the aircon activated?
2012-05-23 17:44:39 andersej: No, I just use it in extreme situations. Afraid they'll give me a cold.
2012-05-23 17:46:30 fangohr: That's the right attitude.
2012-05-23 17:48:52 fangohr: I see from the commit that you are using PetscCusp â€” I think I start to understand now how this works together.
2012-05-23 17:52:09 fangohr_laptop: Hello Anders, Fangohr, DokosBot. (Just struggling with IRC clients hereâ€¦)
2012-05-23 18:34:06 andersej: Hehe, fangohr_laptop was new.. Yes, I've started to test out the gpu solver. Just got remote access to Maxim's computer. The problem now is that small sets of equations take longer time to copy to the gpu than we gain by solving them there. Larger sets take forever to build the boundary element matrix as we have to use the python-magpar code. So I haven't seen any speedup in our code yet.
2012-05-23 18:40:57 andersej: How is the conference?
2012-05-25 16:28:33 MaximS: Hi Anders
2012-05-25 17:29:11 andersej: Hello!
2012-05-25 18:08:42 andersej: Have a nice weekend, DokosBot! Over and out!
2012-05-28 13:40:17 MaximS: hi all
2012-05-28 14:24:27 andersej: Ha, Maxim!
2012-05-28 14:24:33 andersej: *Hi
2012-05-28 14:38:46 MaximS: How is it going with your GPU tests?
2012-05-28 14:41:21 MaximS: I have to go now but I'd like to question you something about the demag field. I want to perform a test for my code ...
2012-05-28 14:41:24 MaximS: see you
2012-05-28 14:42:10 andersej: It's going well, you can ask what you want any time.
2012-05-29 12:25:19 fangohr_laptop: Morning, Anders, DokosBot.
2012-05-29 12:25:25 fangohr_laptop: Sorry, this should read Good afternoon.
2012-05-29 12:25:31 andersej: Hello, Hans!
2012-05-29 12:26:40 fangohr_laptop: Anything exciting happening?
2012-05-29 12:31:22 andersej: No, not really. Just testing some things that might increase the speed of the gpu solver, but I really don't think it will give much speedup. I also got an idea on the Fenics on Iridis-project, so I'm testing that as well now. Are you in Hamburg as we speak?
2012-05-29 12:36:11 fangohr_laptop: I am at the moment in Heathrow, waiting for boarding. (Marking some student work but thought it might be more fun to see what you are up to ;))
2012-05-29 12:36:26 fangohr_laptop: Yes, okay [regarding GPU stuff].
2012-05-29 12:36:46 fangohr_laptop: Have dealt with the 'copy()' issue? I suppose that would be good, and then maybe abandon the GPU study.
2012-05-29 12:40:31 andersej: Hehe, sorry that I'm not up to anything more exciting.. I think I have dealt with the copy issue for the zero vector. That is, I just removed the .copy() and ran all the tests.
2012-05-29 12:40:46 fangohr_laptop: Do the timings get any better?
2012-05-29 12:41:12 andersej: No.
2012-05-29 12:41:28 andersej: I'm trying with different methods and preconditioners now.
2012-05-29 12:43:29 fangohr_laptop: Just to check: instead of copying, you keep two matrices in memomy, and assign values of the first to the second where previously we have copied the first to the second? That's the way it should be.
2012-05-29 12:43:58 fangohr_laptop: When you are done with this, and you need another new task, there is a 'smallish' story that you might be able to do in an afternoon which would make Marijan very happy: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/27283415
2012-05-29 12:45:49 andersej: The thing is that the vector is supposed to be a zero vector for the laplace equation. But when we apply bc to it, it's no longer zero for the next time step. But the bcs are always applied for the same nodes, so I don't think the copy is needed. I guess it's just as code to show our code to the developer when I get back home, and ask why de don't get more speedup on the phi2 solve. For the phi1 I really don't think we could expect more than ~40%
2012-05-29 12:45:50 andersej: speedup, those 4x speedup tests were made on specific hardware and code just to advertise for their solver.
2012-05-29 12:48:52 andersej: Ya, I'll take a look at the DMI story after lunch.
2012-05-29 12:50:30 fangohr_laptop: Okay, great on all accounts. I better find my gate. Over and out.
2012-05-31 15:35:41 andersej: Goodbye, DokosBot!
2012-05-31 17:33:48 fangohr_laptop: Hello MA, Gabriel ;-)
2012-05-31 17:33:55 fangohr_laptop: Has Anders left us already?
2012-05-31 18:18:57 fangohr_laptop: Over and out.
2012-06-06 14:01:27 fangohr: Hello DokosBot. Not unexpectely, this place seems a bit deserted at the moment. I guess we are missing Anders ;-)
2012-06-13 10:33:01 Fangohr1: Hello DokosBot :)
2012-06-19 09:08:03 fangohr: Morning, Neil.
2012-06-19 15:20:59 fangohr-adium: Welcome Marijan. If you want to discuss your next Skyrmion steps, or don't know where to start, feel free to drop in anytime.
2012-06-19 15:54:47 fangohr-adium: Hi Justin, welcome.
2012-06-19 15:55:59 JustinD: Hi Hans, thanks :)
2012-06-19 17:09:32 fangohr-adium: Over and out for today.
2012-06-20 09:08:02 fangohr-adium: Morning Neil, DokosBot.
2012-06-20 09:41:06 fangohr-adium: Morning Justin, Maxim. Are you both in Building 25?
2012-06-20 09:42:14 fangohr-adium: If so, maybe introduce yourself to each other: Justin, Maxim is doing the GPU work with PyOpenCL I mentioned before. Maxim, Justin should be at Sebastian's desk (if he is at uni).
2012-06-20 09:55:51 fangohr-adium: Good morning Marc-Antonio. Your IRC channel proves to be popular.
2012-06-20 10:08:43 mb8g11: Good morning!
2012-06-20 10:09:40 mb8g11: Hi Weiwei ;)
2012-06-20 10:09:53 fangohr-adium: Hi Weiwei, indeed ;-)
2012-06-20 10:10:10 ww1g11: Hi all
2012-06-20 10:10:13 mb8g11: @fangohr-adium: Great! I didn't expect to find that much people.
2012-06-20 10:10:33 fangohr: I know -- it's crazy. But nice.
2012-06-20 10:10:42 fangohr: I won't go for lunch today, by the way (Volleyball).
2012-06-20 10:13:50 JustinD: Morning everyone
2012-06-20 10:14:41 JustinD: @fangohr-adium Yes, I'm in building 25 at the moment
2012-06-20 10:16:31 MaximS: Hi Justin! Will you be at the office tomorrow?
2012-06-20 10:17:48 JustinD: Hi Maxim, no, but I'll be back in the office on Tuesday morning
2012-06-20 10:23:05 MaximS: Ok, then I suggest you email me whenever you'll have questions about OpenCL. When you start working with OpenCL we can have a look at my work as an example.
2012-06-20 10:25:56 MaximS: Good morning Hans, Thank you for your email. I plan to visit you around 10am tomorrow.
2012-06-20 10:26:03 JustinD: Thanks, that would be great. I probably won't look at it for a week or so, but I'll come over and introduce myself anyway if I see you in the office before I begin looking at OpenCL.
2012-06-20 10:27:04 MaximS: What's your native language?
2012-06-20 10:32:41 mb8g11: l337
2012-06-20 10:32:50 JustinD: @MaximS English and Russian both work for me
2012-06-20 10:33:23 MaximS: @mb8g11:  ;)
2012-06-20 10:34:16 mb8g11: ^^
2012-06-20 10:35:15 MaximS: I speak Russian as well but I doubt it will be easy for me to speak about OpenCL in Russian. Well, see you soon!
2012-06-20 10:36:24 JustinD: Cool, yeah I don't know how good my technical language is in Russian to be honest. Would probably beat 1337 though
2012-06-20 14:01:36 fangohr-adium: Weiwei, Marijan, MA, shall we get started with the Dolfin-Boost session?
2012-06-20 14:01:58 marijan: we are coming
2012-06-21 11:54:27 fangohr: Hi Marc-Antonio, Weiwei.
2012-06-21 12:02:11 mb8g11: Hi Hans.
2012-06-21 12:02:28 fangohr: Hello. Anybody feeling a bit hungry?
2012-06-21 12:03:38 fangohr: I'll probably wait another 30 minutes, but then some food will be required.
2012-06-21 12:25:11 ww1g11: Hi Hans, just notice the chat, I am not hungry, it seems in the morning I ate too much
2012-06-21 12:25:25 fangohr: No worries ;-)
2012-06-21 12:25:40 fangohr: I probably just grab a sandwhich.
2012-06-21 12:26:15 mb8g11: I am hungry!
2012-06-21 12:26:49 fangohr: okay, maybe I can be persuaded to eat proper food. Are you around?
2012-06-21 12:30:08 mb8g11: Yes, want to go now?
2012-06-21 12:30:24 fangohr: 5 minutes or so?
2012-06-21 12:30:59 fangohr: Staff club?
2012-06-21 12:32:33 mb8g11: Yes.
2012-06-21 12:32:47 fangohr: Okay. I'll pick you up in 5mins.
2012-06-21 16:12:18 mb8g11: fangohr: remember the bug we talked about during lunch? About the order in which parameters are set?
2012-06-21 16:12:34 mb8g11: Simple typo. https://bitbucket.org/fangohr/finmag/changeset/b398200a0932
2012-06-21 16:19:33 mb8g11: weiwei: df.inner(df.grad(M), df.grad(M))
2012-06-21 16:34:12 fangohr: Nice.
2012-06-21 16:55:08 fangohr: Over and out.
2012-06-29 16:20:13 fangohr_laptop: I was going to suggest xchat.
2012-06-29 16:20:46 JustinD: ye, i tried to get mIRC because it was the one I had before, but couldn't find it for linux
2012-06-29 17:00:40 JustinD: I've pushed those example files you asked for onto the repository
2012-06-29 17:00:59 fangohr_laptop: Nice, thanks.
2012-06-29 18:13:15 fangohr_laptop: Over and out.
2012-07-02 15:43:50 smashdot: Hi all.
2012-07-02 15:44:10 JustinD: Hi
2012-07-02 15:44:15 smashdot: (Marc-Antonio here)
2012-07-02 15:45:11 JustinD: I would introduce myself, but my nickname probably does the trick :)
2012-07-02 15:50:49 smashdot: It does!
2012-07-02 17:24:19 smashdot: There's a problem with the build... there's an example that won't stop running.
2012-07-02 17:26:38 smashdot: Ah, saw it's possible to abort the build.
2012-07-03 10:47:13 fangohr-adium: Hi Marc-antonio, you should find on osiris.sesnet.soton.ac.uk in /tmp a file nmag-meta.tar.gz with the discussed tarball.
2012-07-03 10:48:50 fangohr-adium: The relevant examples are in nmag-meta/test/devtests/nmag/slonczewski.
2012-07-03 10:49:24 fangohr-adium: There is a 'validation' and a 'oscillation' example. One of them has been used in the report I have sent you before, and also has code to compare against oommf.
2012-07-03 10:49:48 fangohr-adium: I don't know off-hand where the actual implementation is hiding, but I think you have enough to info to grep for it. If you are stuck, let me know.
2012-07-03 10:52:36 mb8g11: Downloading as we speak, thank you.
2012-07-03 10:54:00 mb8g11: I should be able to find it with the infos you gave me. The example files likely include the files I need in some way.
2012-07-03 12:39:16 mb8g11: See you later.
2012-07-09 07:58:13 mb8g11: Good morning!
2012-07-16 17:32:26 fangohr: Over and out.
2012-07-18 09:56:40 fangohr: Good morning, DokosBot. You have been offline yesterday.
2012-07-18 17:57:10 JustinD: Hi Hans, Should I throttle down the simulation I sent over to your machine? It looks like it's using up all the cpu power it can get.
2012-07-31 08:48:32 mb8g11: Hey.
2012-08-01 16:10:25 fangohr-adium: Greetings :)
2012-08-01 16:23:41 fangohr-adium: Marc-Antonio, are you still there?
2012-08-01 16:42:29 fangohr-adium: MA, I'll catch up with you later â€” it's not urgent.
2012-08-01 20:00:54 Fangohr: Hello, connectin from smartphone - lets see how this works out.
2012-08-02 08:16:50 mb8g11: Hello DokosBot!
2012-08-02 08:27:54 mb8g11: exit
2012-08-02 23:47:03 fangohr: Good night, DokosBot.
2012-08-06 09:54:25 mb8g11: Hello Hans!
2012-08-06 11:17:34 mb8g11: fangohr-adium?
2012-08-07 08:37:32 mb8g11: Good morning.
2012-08-28 11:39:18 fangohr-adium: Hello Dokosbot! Long time no see.
2012-08-28 14:37:36 fangohr-adium: Greetings. I have written a few more emails :)
2012-08-28 14:39:36 mb8g11: Great.
2012-08-28 14:45:26 mb8g11: I remember looking into something called mesh functions in dolfin. They are functions that live on particular areas of the mesh. The question remains if we can map netgen's regions to dolfin meshes.
2012-08-28 14:56:54 mb8g11: Max?
2012-08-28 14:58:07 albert: Yes!
2012-08-28 14:58:31 mb8g11: Cool.
2012-08-28 14:58:37 albert: :-)
2012-08-28 14:59:25 albert: How's things in Hamburg?
2012-08-28 15:00:46 mb8g11: Fine :)
2012-08-28 15:01:16 mb8g11: Oh, we didn't instruct you how to join us on IRC, did we?
2012-08-28 15:02:43 albert: Well, I asked Hans a while ago and then did it successully once or twice, but since activity seemed rather low I forgot about it again.
2012-08-28 15:02:46 fangohr-adium1: Greetings, Max. :)
2012-08-28 15:03:08 fangohr-adium1: Adium (Mac OS X only) can autologin, it seems. Very useful. Xchat can do it sometimes.
2012-08-28 15:03:51 albert: Will try to remain connected in the future, and it might be useful to advertise it again to the other team members, just to have another means of communicating quickly.
2012-08-28 15:03:58 albert: Thanks Hans, I'll look into it.
2012-08-28 15:04:18 mb8g11: I you're into command line clients, I can recommend irssi.
2012-08-28 15:04:31 mb8g11: Could send you my config file, it does autologin.
2012-08-28 15:04:39 fangohr-adium1: That sounds interesting. Which OSs are supported?
2012-08-28 15:05:42 fangohr-adium1: More specifically: Mac OS X and Linux I am interested in.
2012-08-28 15:05:51 mb8g11: OS X, Linux, and apparently even windows (haven't tried)
2012-08-28 15:06:09 fangohr-adium1: Ta.
2012-08-28 15:06:15 mb8g11: It's in the ubuntu repositories.
2012-08-28 15:15:16 fangohr-adium1: Could you put the config file somewhere?
2012-08-28 15:19:29 mb8g11: Of course, in a minute.

2012-08-28 15:28:16 mb8g11: weird issue with the spellchecker, here is the correct one: http://pastebin.com/yVhnmAN5
2012-08-28 15:32:42 albert: Thanks for the tip, Marc-Antonio. And also thanks for the config file. Do you know if irssi can do desktop notifications if you're working on a different workspace than the one where it's running?
2012-08-28 15:33:30 mb8g11: Sorry, no idea.
2012-08-28 15:34:17 albert: No prob. :)
2012-08-28 16:00:06 fangohr-adium1: Ta.
2012-08-28 16:00:30 fangohr-adium1: MA, Where does the irssi config file go (on linux)? In .irssi I presume, but what is the filename?
2012-08-28 16:02:19 mb8g11: ~/.irssi/config      (http://irssi.org/documentation/manual)
2012-08-28 16:05:22 fangohr-adium1: Thanks.

2012-08-28 17:00:55 mb8g11: Bye!
2012-08-29 09:14:35 fangohr-adium1: Morning all.
2012-08-29 09:14:44 fangohr-adium1: Max, are you back already, still there, or not logged out? ;-)
2012-08-29 14:08:45 fangohr-adium1: Hi MA :)
2012-08-29 14:39:47 mb8g11: HI :)
2012-08-29 15:30:31 mb8g11: Haha, running netgen in graphical mode. Managed to bring down my X-Server.
2012-08-29 15:49:54 fangohr-adium1: How did you do that? Should 'just work' shouldn't it?
2012-08-29 16:00:16 mb8g11: Didn't read the docu carefully enough. Thought cylinders were bounded, in fact they are infinitely long.
2012-08-29 16:00:32 mb8g11: Forgot to cut them off with planes.
2012-08-29 16:10:35 mb8g11: 16:59 < mb8g11> Didn't read the docu carefully enough. Thought cylinders were bounded, in fact they are infinitely long.
2012-08-29 16:10:38 mb8g11: 16:59 < mb8g11> Forgot to cut them off with planes.
2012-08-29 16:13:09 fangohr-adium: I see â€” have done that as well. And then your mesh gets quite big and you run out of memory, or it just crashes? The latter would be silghly disappointing, but then again we shouldn't complain too much about a free tool.
2012-08-29 16:15:08 mb8g11: Crashed. Not really complaining, although it irks me that netgen seldomly exits correctly.
2012-08-29 16:26:32 fangohr-adium: Ah, yes, I agree. I very much dislike the reliable segfault when batch execution 'completes'.
2012-08-29 16:56:12 fangohr-adium: Hi MA,  have just run your 'point_contacts.py' script: the round mesh looks good. The current doesn't quite match the nice mesh in the visualisation. Made some suggestions and committed.
2012-08-29 16:58:27 mb8g11: Thank you!
2012-08-29 16:59:34 mb8g11: Alas, I have run into a bug with our integrator. When running run_until(t) in a loop, the value for t inside that loop may not be what we expect.
2012-08-29 17:00:14 mb8g11: It can even be constant for several iterations of that loop, which will upset the saving of snapshots (duplicate filenames because of that problem).
2012-08-29 17:00:36 mb8g11: That's how I noticed it in the first place. Looking into it.
2012-08-29 17:01:32 fangohr-adium: Where do you interact with this? In the calling of the computation of the right hand side?
2012-08-29 17:03:12 mb8g11: As a user? When we call sim.llg.t. That value is weird. In our integrator self.cur_t is 0 the entire time as well. Weirdness all around.
2012-08-29 17:04:08 fangohr-adium: I recall that cur_t is not updated from C code although it should be. Never managed to look further into this, I think this is a bug.
2012-08-29 17:05:18 fangohr-adium: The other thing that may happen is that sundials can decide which values of t it wants to use when calling the right hand side. It can go forward or backward in time, or use the same value of t repeatedly (part of the iterative process, and part of cvode's cleverness in 'probing' the ODEs to pick the right time step, etc. What you describe sounds a bit like it.
2012-08-29 17:06:25 fangohr-adium: This also means that when sundials returns control to us (i.e. run_until(t) returns), we cannot trust that the values in H_demag is that of the time t. It could be for another t, which sundials decided to explore before deciding that it's current value for t is good enough to return to us.
2012-08-29 17:06:27 fangohr-adium: Do I make any sense?
2012-08-29 17:06:32 mb8g11: It does. Hmm. We'll have to save the "expected" simulation time as well. The one we expect after a call to run_until.
2012-08-29 17:06:51 mb8g11: You do.
2012-08-29 17:20:42 mb8g11: Good thing this channel is logged.
2012-08-29 17:31:11 fangohr-adium: Leaving for today; bye Dokosbot.
2012-08-30 09:08:26 fangohr-adium: Good Morning.
2012-08-30 11:12:05 fangohr-adium: Greetings.
2012-08-30 12:01:22 mb8g11: Hello.
2012-08-30 13:22:42 mb8g11: Thought about what you said yesterday, about the interactions not being in sync with the simulation or m, because of the integrator skipping ahead or resting. In theory, that sounds like a problem. But in practice we haven't caught it in our unit tests. Do you think this is something I should investigate?
2012-08-31 10:25:31 mb8g11: Hello
2012-08-31 10:26:25 fangohr-adium: Hi MA, regarding the time step: in theory (and in the past) the time step issue should not be an issue AS LONG as the only information we use from sundials is the statevector y (i.e. the magnetisation at the moment) and the time t.
2012-08-31 10:26:32 fangohr-adium: More discussion of this:
2012-08-31 10:27:19 fangohr-adium: We ask sundials (take as synonym here for CVODE) to integrate our ODEs for a given starting m0 and t0 up to a new t and to determine m=m(t). It will do that in its own way (and we should not care about it), and when it completes, it returns to us the desired m(t).
2012-08-31 10:28:37 fangohr-adium: What happens internally is that it may well use time steps that do not lead directly to our desired t; for example it may skip ahead to "t+some delta t" because that is the step size it considers appropriate, and then use interpolation from the previous t it has used to our desired t, using the information it has for "t+some delta t".
2012-08-31 10:29:21 fangohr-adium: I think this is the situation we see in the current version of the sandbox/interference_patterns/run.py programm: sundials only computes a new dm/dt for a few times, and providse interpolated results in between.
2012-08-31 10:30:45 fangohr-adium: The one thing we must not do, is to use the information that has been created when sundials has called our code to compute dm/dt, etc. for example we should not use the demag field values â€” while these will have been updated by sundials when calling the code to compute dm/dt â€”  we don't know for what time this was. )This problem arises because we share the same data with sundials.)
2012-08-31 10:30:50 fangohr-adium: Does that clarify the situation?
2012-08-31 10:33:36 mb8g11: Yes.
2012-08-31 10:35:50 fangohr-adium: Nice.
2012-08-31 10:36:08 mb8g11: When we ask for field energy values, we do this mostly at equilibrium. So it shouldn't matter much if the integrator (and thus the fields) is a little ahead of our sim.
2012-08-31 10:36:10 fangohr-adium: I start to wander whether we should circulate all the IRC communication every night to everybody; to keep people up-to-date.
2012-08-31 10:37:06 fangohr-adium: Regarding energy: I think when we request this, we do actually compute it at that moment, based on the current m. So that should be absolutely accurate.
2012-08-31 10:37:36 mb8g11: And if we really, really need an accurate reading, we can feed the actual m to the computation.
2012-08-31 10:38:16 mb8g11: Oh, that's right. Even better.
2012-08-31 10:40:48 mb8g11: Same for the fields when we call compute_field()
2012-08-31 10:41:05 mb8g11: So, keepin this in mind, it all becomes a non-issue.
2012-08-31 10:43:49 mb8g11: About the logs: There's the commit message on bitbucket.
2012-08-31 11:00:49 mb8g11: Wait. Actually, when sundials asks us to compute the right hand side for a value of m, we store that m as our magnetisation.
2012-08-31 11:46:17 fangohr-adium: Hey, DokosBot: I just got an email from Anders â€” he asks me to send his regards to you.
2012-08-31 13:29:10 fangohr-adium: Hi MA, welcome back.
2012-08-31 13:29:30 sMAshdot: Hi Hans!
2012-08-31 13:30:07 fangohr-adium: Regarding logs: most people do not get commits emailed, I think, they need to look them up. So I am not sure this is good enough. On the other hand, I don't want to annoy folks with too much input. Let's wait and see.
2012-08-31 13:30:31 fangohr-adium: Regarding: "Wait. Actually, when sundials asks us to compute the right hand side for a value of m, we store that m as our magnetisation."
2012-08-31 13:31:13 fangohr-adium: Yes, that's right. However, when sundials returns control to us, we take the last m it returns to us, and put this into the dolfin m-Function. That is the point where we put the right data into m. As long as we compute all other fields based on that m, we should be okay.
2012-08-31 13:31:14 sMAshdot: Yes, that was premature.
2012-08-31 13:31:22 sMAshdot: Yes.
2012-08-31 13:45:46 sMAshdot: Thanks for the explanations :)
2012-08-31 18:19:51 mb8g11: Bye!
2012-09-03 08:44:42 fangohr: Good Morning, DokosBot.
2012-09-03 10:23:46 fangohr-adium: Good Morning, MA.
2012-09-03 11:48:48 mb8g11: Hello!
2012-09-03 15:44:24 fangohr-adium: Hello Weiwei, well done ;-)
2012-09-03 15:45:10 ww1g11: Hi Hans, :)
2012-09-03 15:52:28 fangohr-adium: Hi Weiwei. Does Marijan need help?
2012-09-03 16:06:41 ww1g11: just want to test the alerts
2012-09-03 16:08:25 mb8g11: Discussed the critical timestep problem on pivotal tracker.
2012-09-03 16:08:35 fangohr-adium: Hi Marijan, well done.
2012-09-03 16:08:44 fangohr-adium: Weiwei, I have your logbook ready on: https://bitbucket.org/fangohr/logbook-weiwei-wang
2012-09-03 16:08:50 fangohr-adium: Marijan's is next.
2012-09-03 16:09:02 ww1g11: got it, thanks
2012-09-03 16:18:22 fangohr-adium: Marijan, your logbook should be at https://bitbucket.org/fangohr/logbook-marijan-beg
2012-09-03 16:18:26 fangohr-adium: Any problems, let me know.
2012-09-03 16:22:03 marijan: I've got it.
2012-09-03 16:22:06 marijan: Thanks
2012-09-03 16:23:06 fangohr-adium: Great. Try to run the 'make_html.sh' and 'make_pdf.sh' files â€” this will tell if you have all required tools installed (probably not). Do ask for help.
2012-09-03 16:23:17 fangohr-adium: q
2012-09-03 16:26:52 mb8g11: Are these makefiles for compiling the logbooks to something nice to look at?
2012-09-03 16:27:51 marijan: I do not have this rst2html.py file....
2012-09-03 16:35:44 fangohr-adium: MA: yes, I guess I should have given you the files as well. I'll email you a tarball of the set in a moment.
2012-09-03 16:36:24 fangohr-adium: Marijan: this is part of python's 'docutils' package. You could try 'easy_install docutils' (or Max may suggest something like 'pip docutils'?)
2012-09-03 16:36:52 fangohr-adium: Also check whether maybe you have the file 'rst2html', i.e. without the .py. Both do the same, and if you have the 'rst2html' you can change the command in the 'make_html.sh' file.
2012-09-03 16:37:59 albert: fangohr-adium: I think the command should be "pip install docutils", although the default Ubuntu python-docutils packages should be just fine if you don't need any recent functionality.
2012-09-03 16:38:54 fangohr-adium: I think Marijan is on his Mac. So I don't know which Python he uses (could be enthought).
2012-09-03 16:39:05 fangohr-adium: Or he maybe working on his virtual machine; don't know.
2012-09-03 16:40:01 marijan: I am on my Mac, and I cannot use easy_install command, because access to Python folder is denied. I will try to install it on Ubuntu.
2012-09-03 16:40:33 albert: Ah, if it's on a Mac and you are using Macports (which Hans suggests you don't) then you might need to use pip-2.7 (or whatever your python version is) to install the correct package.
2012-09-03 16:41:02 albert: marijan, have you uses sudo for installing the package?
2012-09-03 16:44:18 marijan: Yes, sudo was the problem. I installed it and everything works fine.
2012-09-03 16:44:20 marijan: Thank
2012-09-03 16:44:31 albert: Cool :)
2012-09-03 16:44:36 fangohr-adium: Great, thanks Max.
2012-09-03 16:44:45 albert: Apologies for a totally unrelated question:
2012-09-03 16:44:55 albert:  I was thinking that it would be handy to pass an exchange coupling constant and anisotropy constant to the  Simulation class (when it's initialised) so that it adds an exchange and anisotropy interaction automatically.
2012-09-03 16:45:08 albert: I.e., without the need to do it manually, e.g. via "sim.add(exchange)" or something similar.
2012-09-03 16:45:42 albert: In nmag this is solved by defining a MagMaterial first, and passing this on to the simulation class.
2012-09-03 16:45:49 fangohr-adium: Sounds good to me. You may also need to pass Ms?
2012-09-03 16:45:52 albert: Is there a reason we don't do this in Finmag?
2012-09-03 16:46:12 fangohr-adium: No, there is no particular reason. I think we just haven't made it to the high-level convenience functions yet.
2012-09-03 16:46:35 albert: And if we want to have this shortcut, would it be better to introduce a Material class (which might be just a simple wrapper for the time being), or would it be better to pass the constants to the Simulation class directly?
2012-09-03 16:46:46 fangohr-adium: It is an opportunity to review design choices though, so I quite like to not blindly copy from Nmag (at least initially).
2012-09-03 16:47:00 fangohr-adium: I don't know what is better. ;-)
2012-09-03 16:48:10 fangohr-adium: It is also not clear that the materials class will survive: we can use material parameters where properties change as a function space. So maybe there is no need to have different materials (at least as long as we want exchange coupling between the different materials).
2012-09-03 16:49:10 albert: Well, I quite like the flexibility in Finmag at the moment, for example that you can add multiple anisotropy terms etc. This should definitely be retained.
2012-09-03 16:49:31 fangohr-adium: Yes.
2012-09-03 16:49:41 albert: So I was thinking to maybe add three optional parameters to the Simulation.__init__() function:
2012-09-03 16:49:51 albert: A -- the exchange coupling constant
2012-09-03 16:50:03 albert: K1 -- the (uniaxial) anisotropy constant
2012-09-03 16:50:27 albert: and a 'demag_solver' argument, which would just be a string
2012-09-03 16:50:54 albert: by default, they are None or something equivalent, which signifies that they shouldn't be initialised
2012-09-03 16:51:32 albert: but if the user provides them then internally an exchange/anisotropy/demag interaction is automatically added
2012-09-03 16:52:21 albert: for example, providing A=13.0e-12 in the sim.__init__() function would be equivalent to saying:
2012-09-03 16:52:33 albert: exchange = Exchange(A)
2012-09-03 16:52:40 albert: sim.add(exchange)
2012-09-03 16:53:30 albert: So it would just be a shortcut, with slightly limited functionality (namely, that you can only initialise a single exchange/anisotropy/demag interaction via the __init__() function).
2012-09-03 16:53:37 albert: But you could of course add more of them later on.
2012-09-03 16:53:49 albert: Does this make sense? Or does anyone have a better suggestion?
2012-09-03 17:05:47 fangohr-adium: Max, sounds certainly appealing, and will be useful for many applications. There is a very small concern about modifying the class as it is now as it will be difficult to change later. Alternatives would be to derive a convenience class for one-material default values from the current class, which then provides the functionality you describe. We could then use other (derived) classes if we wanted to change the userinterface. On the other hand, I d
2012-09-03 17:08:06 albert: I have just given it a bit more thought and I agree that it's probably not a good idea to cram it all into the interface of the Simulation class.
2012-09-03 17:08:34 albert: But having a derived convenience class sounds like a very good idea.
2012-09-03 17:09:20 albert: If I get too fed up with adding interactions manually I might write one soon, thanks for the suggestion.
2012-09-03 17:09:41 albert: (Ideas for names are welcome, I'm quite bad at coming up with good names.)
2012-09-03 17:09:58 fangohr-adium: That would be fine by me: if it is derived, you can do withit what you like (and likely everybody will be using it soon) but cannot ccause any damage. Please proceed if you like :)
2012-09-03 17:10:57 fangohr-adium: Names: don't know: 'SimulationOneMaterial', â€” too long. May not even be true (as material parameters can vary).
2012-09-03 17:11:14 fangohr-adium: Or maybe just 'sim'? Very convenient, but maybe overconfident.
2012-09-03 17:11:36 albert: Perhaps "SimpleSimulation" or "SimpleSim"?
2012-09-03 17:11:39 fangohr-adium: How about 'sim1' â€” reading this as the first version of convenience class that we call 'sim' because that is to conveniently short?
2012-09-03 17:12:02 albert: That doesn't sound bad.
2012-09-03 17:12:05 fangohr-adium: SimpleSim is also fine with me.
2012-09-03 17:12:18 fangohr-adium: (or maybe SimpleSim1?)
2012-09-03 17:12:36 fangohr-adium: Could also bring in micromagnetics: SimpleMag1 ?
2012-09-03 17:13:11 fangohr-adium: I need to leave for the day; good catching up with people today - bye for now.
2012-09-03 17:13:29 albert: Thanks, and see you later!
2012-09-03 19:41:55 fangohr: Hi MA, Max, do you get email notifications when commits are pushed to bitbucket? (I do, and I think we should just sent those to everybody â€” this will deliver the IRC logs, and also keep everybody up to date as to what is happening). Any views?
2012-09-03 19:43:09 albert: Yes, I do get email notifications (but I had to turn them on explicitly last week).
2012-09-03 19:43:10 albert: I personally think it would be useful to email commits to everybody. It's not very high traffic, but it's useful to see what has been going on.
2012-09-03 19:43:42 mb8g11: test
2012-09-03 19:43:59 fangohr: That's my view as well.
2012-09-03 19:44:09 fangohr: Hello MA, testing, one, two. One, two.
2012-09-03 19:44:10 fangohr: ;-)
2012-09-03 19:44:11 mb8g11: I wouldn't mind getting e-mails for commits.
2012-09-03 19:44:39 albert: Have any of the other guys expressed an opinion?
2012-09-03 19:44:47 fangohr: Fine, let's do that. I can switch this on centrally by adding email addresses for diffs.
2012-09-03 19:45:34 fangohr: No, I don't know from Marijan and Weiwei but I expect htey have never had the chance to work with diff notifications, so I am quite happy to let them test it and later ask wether it is useful to them.
2012-09-03 19:45:47 fangohr: We can toggle this on/off individually, so no problem.
2012-09-03 19:45:53 albert: Sounds good.
2012-09-03 19:46:04 fangohr: Shall I add you two as well? (and if so, which email addresses are preferred?)
2012-09-03 19:46:31 albert: Yes please. You can use maximilian.albert@gmail.com for me.
2012-09-03 19:47:52 fangohr: OKay, have added all soton addresses otherwise. Let's see how it goes.
2012-09-03 19:48:16 mb8g11: Thank you.
2012-09-03 19:55:21 mb8g11: @SimpleSim: This doesn't save anything Sim wouldn't, meaning, it has no additional state, does it? So why not simply have a helper function, maybe called add_to_sim(sim, A, (K1, a)) or so.
2012-09-03 19:55:43 mb8g11: or sim = sim_with(A, (K1, a))
2012-09-03 19:55:54 mb8g11: like some kind of factory
2012-09-03 19:57:04 mb8g11: I'm sure we could come up with better ideas, but subclassing is not the way to go IMHO.
2012-09-03 20:00:40 fangohr: Yes, that's the other option that seems sensible: to have a function that generates the simulation object. I find it hard to see what's better; so either is fine with me.
2012-09-03 20:01:35 mb8g11: In fact, I'd like to have Simulation as the convenience class, and will try to move some code from there to lower levels or helpers (but keep the interface in Simulation).
2012-09-03 20:03:48 albert: mb8g11,  you are probably right about using a helper function rather than a subclass. I like the "sim_with(...)" syntax.
2012-09-03 20:05:13 mb8g11: Subclassing was not "wrong", a SimpleSimulation sounds like it has a "is a" relationship to Simulation. But why not make the first class more convenient, instead of inventing a second one.
2012-09-03 20:05:51 mb8g11: To keep it manageable, we will have to take care to push the low-level code to where it belongs, or can be grouped into
2012-09-03 20:06:05 mb8g11: (it being our original Simulation clasS)
2012-09-03 20:07:54 albert: So how are you imagining to make the Simulation class more convenient ? Other than with additional helper functions, that is? (Or was this the route you were suggesting?)
2012-09-03 20:10:29 mb8g11: For this particular problem, with helper functions. Other than that... I may lack the experience/foresight to see what we need. I may be utterly wrong considering new examples you can come up with :)
2012-09-03 20:11:52 mb8g11: I'd like to be able to build a dolfin mesh from a maximum simplex size, instead of telling it the number of simplices I want. That would be nice, but has nothing to do with the Simulation class.
2012-09-03 20:12:45 albert: Ok, I guess we'll see along the way what we need. But yes, I like the idea of making the Simulation class as convenient as possible and move helper stuff somewhere else.
2012-09-03 20:13:13 albert: Oh, how do you specify the number of simplices in a mesh? Is this with Netgen or using the Dolfin built-in functions?
2012-09-03 20:15:25 mb8g11: Dolfin built-in. dolfin.Rectangle(x0, y0, x1, y1, xn, yn), x0,x1 being the coordinates and xn and yn the number of divisions.
2012-09-03 20:16:08 mb8g11: the order of the first four arguments may be wrong.
2012-09-03 20:16:41 albert: Ah, of course, that's obvious. Sorry for the silly question, I was too much thinking in terms of Netgen.
2012-09-03 20:16:49 mb8g11: We all do.
2012-09-03 20:17:40 mb8g11: Who cares about the number of divisions in a particular direction, as long as there is a way to say how fine the mesh has to be (maxh in netgen).
2012-09-03 20:19:32 albert: Well, for this particular kind of mesh it would be easy to compute (and to provide a simple helper function). But for other mesh types provided by Dolfin it may not so obvious.
2012-09-03 20:21:20 mb8g11: Could be.
2012-09-03 20:23:31 albert: Totally different question: have you ever seen an error like this when running Finmag?
2012-09-03 20:23:35 albert: RuntimeError:

2012-09-03 20:24:16 albert: I've stumbled upon it a few times recently, but it doesn't seem to be 100% reproducible (sometimes it works with the exact same parameters).
2012-09-03 20:24:28 mb8g11: Yes, when I play with the tolerances of the demag solver too much, or mix up the unit lengths with netgen meshes.
2012-09-03 20:24:57 mb8g11: With the exact same parameters? Weird.
2012-09-03 20:26:02 albert: Yes, I found that weird too.
2012-09-03 20:26:46 albert: Do you have any suggestions what may most likely be causing it (i.e., what to change so that it goes away)?
2012-09-03 20:27:27 albert: Also, is it worth investigating this further, or is it simply a result of badly chosen parameters? (However, the ones I have at the moment don't seem particularly unreasonable...)
2012-09-03 20:29:42 mb8g11: Have you set m?
2012-09-03 20:29:52 mb8g11: if m is still zero, that could cause the norm nan.
2012-09-03 20:30:44 albert: Argh, I think you are right. I guess I haven't...
2012-09-03 20:33:01 mb8g11: Cool.
2012-09-03 20:33:26 albert: Will double-check, but that's most likely the mistake.
2012-09-03 20:33:54 albert: I ran the simulation with the new convenience class SimpleMag1 (which I'll soon change to the sim_with(...) syntax you suggested above), and I think I forgot to add an m_init argument.
2012-09-03 20:35:30 albert: I guess it's time to go home if this is the sort of silly mistake I'm making... ;-)
2012-09-03 20:40:45 mb8g11: Definitively, haha.
2012-09-03 20:40:56 mb8g11: Here's the incentive, I'll stop now too.
2012-09-03 20:41:08 mb8g11: "See" you tomorrow!
2012-09-03 20:41:40 albert: Have a nice evening, and thanks again!
2012-09-03 20:41:49 mb8g11: for what? ;)
2012-09-03 20:41:53 mb8g11: You too.
2012-09-03 20:42:04 albert: For pointing out silly mistakes. ;-)
2012-09-03 20:42:07 albert: See you!
2012-09-04 09:05:07 fangohr-adium: Good morning DokosBot and Max.
2012-09-04 12:40:41 fangohr-adium: Max, are you out there?
2012-09-04 14:46:49 albert: Hi Hans!
2012-09-04 14:47:49 albert: Sorry I didn't reply earlier. I had set my status to "away" last night, but I'm not sure this is communicated anywhere.
2012-09-04 14:48:30 fangohr-adium:  No, it isn't. No problem though ;-). I sent you an email with my query. (Need to go now - see you tomorrow at 10am for moving offices â€¦ ;) )
2012-09-05 09:21:32 fangohr-adium: Good morning Marijan.
2012-09-05 14:46:56 fangohr-adium: Marijan, the meeting with Ian Hawke is today, is that right?
2012-09-05 14:47:13 marijan: Yes, at 3pm
2012-09-05 14:47:32 fangohr-adium: Okay, thanks. If you have a pdf to flick through, maybe best to email me before.
2012-09-05 14:47:42 marijan: ok
2012-09-05 14:51:55 marijan: I have just send it to you.
2012-09-05 17:18:20 fangohr-adium: Over and out for today.
2012-09-05 17:22:18 albert: Hi Hans, just out of interest: is there a way to access the Finmag IRC logs somewhere online, e.g. to catch up on what has been happening during the day (without having to wait for the Bitbucket commit message at midnight)?
2012-09-05 18:45:56 albert: Oh, and another question: is there a "single-html" version of the Finmag manual available? This would be handy if one wants to quickly search for something.
2012-09-06 09:02:46 fangohr-adium: Hi Max, access the IRC logs: no, that is available, and I agree that this is also missing. Either we should have the availability to check the current logs somewhere, or consider switching to a different group chat forum, where you can log in and get the past discussions, etc. I'll look into it.
2012-09-06 09:03:16 fangohr-adium: Regarding the single-html finmag manual: no, we don't have this, but it would be useful. I think we can create another target in the documentation make file for this.
2012-09-06 10:10:01 fangohr-adium: Good Morning all.
2012-09-06 10:10:17 mb8g11: Good morning!
2012-09-06 10:11:00 marijan: Good morning.
2012-09-06 10:12:43 marijan: Weiwei and I are discussing something about the conference and we haven't got any answer from them although the decision date was yesterday. Should they inform us even if we are rejected?
2012-09-06 10:14:11 fangohr-adium: Yes, they will inform you either way. I suspect they are running behind schedule. I would not worry and wait a week or so.
2012-09-06 10:14:39 marijan: ok
2012-09-06 10:18:37 fangohr-adium: Hi all, Max did ask yesterday whether the finmag irc logs can be seen anywhere DURING the day. I understand why he is asking as it is a common problem. You log out, or your chat client dies, and when you come back, you don't know what has been discussed before. By midnight, it will be committed, and you can check the whole record at https://bitbucket.org/fangohr/finmag/src (in logbooks/finmag-irc.log)
2012-09-06 10:18:44 fangohr-adium: However, before midnight, that information is not available.
2012-09-06 10:19:50 fangohr-adium: As a quick fix, I have written a (pycherry) script that serves the latest changes at http://summer.kk.soton.ac.uk:8008 . It's not pretty but does the job for now. I will commit the code in a moment, it currently runs under my username on summer.kk.soton.ac.uk.
2012-09-06 10:28:36 fangohr-adium: Max, to answer your question from yesterday: 'make singlehtml' in finmag/doc produces the single html file you asked for ;) Was just going to add it, and it was there already.
2012-09-06 16:16:11 fangohr-adium: Max, interesting: your warning message about the 'spurious error on Anders Johansen's' machine shows up on jenkins. See http://summer.kk.soton.ac.uk:8080/job/finmag/850/console
2012-09-06 16:48:47 albert: Hi Hans! Yes, I've seen it a few times on my own machine as well. No idea what it means, though.
2012-09-06 16:52:54 mb8g11_: Is this the predictable failing of netgen, or something else?
2012-09-06 16:54:04 fangohr-adium: Yes, netgen. You can see the error at http://summer.kk.soton.ac.uk:8080/job/finmag/851/console
2012-09-06 16:54:32 fangohr-adium: Max, the compilation went fine. This means that when you go to http://summer.kk.soton.ac.uk:8080/job/finmag/, you can see on the side
2012-09-06 16:54:38 fangohr-adium: 1. html documentation as before
2012-09-06 16:54:43 fangohr-adium: 2. html documentation in single file
2012-09-06 16:54:50 fangohr-adium: 3. pdf documentation
2012-09-06 16:55:14 fangohr-adium: Very good. It also means we are testing that the pdf file can be built; which I always wanted to add. Thank you for reminding me ;-), and your time earlier today.
2012-09-06 16:55:44 albert: Cool, I just saw it. Glad it works!
2012-09-06 17:08:26 fangohr-adium: Over and out.
2012-09-06 17:08:35 albert: See you!
2012-09-07 11:14:49 fangohr-adium: Good Morning DokosBot, CherryPy and Max.
2012-09-07 17:08:19 fangohr-adium: Have a good weekend, over and out for now.
2012-09-11 09:42:05 fangohr-adium: Good morning, Marc-Antonio.
2012-09-11 09:42:09 fangohr-adium: and DokosBot.
2012-09-11 10:22:25 mb8g11: Hi Hans!
2012-09-11 10:27:50 fangohr-adium: Hi MA, Interested in early lunch today (around 12:00, say)?
2012-09-11 10:46:22 mb8g11: Yes.
2012-09-11 10:46:51 fangohr-adium: Cool, let's do that, and also catch up on things.
2012-09-11 10:47:38 mb8g11: Sounds good.
2012-09-11 11:43:40 fangohr-adium: Hi Justin.
2012-09-11 11:44:25 fangohr-adium: Justin, you may have missed that the log of the discussions on IRC of the day is available at: http://summer.kk.soton.ac.uk:8008
2012-09-11 11:56:44 fangohr-adium: Hi all, a number of people seem keen to join us for lunch (including Gerian who is not on this channel). I come along to pick you up now.
2012-09-11 14:08:51 fangohr-adium: Over and out for the day; back tomorrow morning.
2012-09-12 08:51:37 fangohr-adium: Good Morning.
2012-09-12 11:23:05 mb8g11: Lunch at 12:00?
2012-09-12 11:24:14 JustinD: Sure, that works for me
2012-09-12 15:38:34 fangohr-adium: Hi folks, sorry, missed the message (and didn't do food either today).
2012-09-12 17:22:16 fangohr-adium: Over and out for today.
2012-09-13 09:27:20 fangohr-adium: Good morning all.
2012-09-13 09:27:42 JustinD: Good morning
2012-09-13 14:48:50 mb8g11: Just had a really nice chat with Richard Boardman.
2012-09-13 14:50:44 fangohr-adium: Good â€” he his done lots of stuff in OOMMF and Magpar in the days before Nmag; approximately 2002-2005. He is also the visualisation guru, and would routinely take VTK-vector scenes and export them to povray or other raytracers.
2012-09-13 14:50:55 mb8g11: Besides some nostalgia about micromagnetics on his part, he seems to be really knowledgeable about parallel computing.
2012-09-13 14:52:19 mb8g11: And he is intrigued by fenics. Definitily some potential to trade a few hints :)
2012-09-13 14:53:09 fangohr-adium: Yes â€” I had a chat with him about fenics last week and tried to sell it to him (or rather to one of the post-docs in his group).
2012-09-13 14:53:40 fangohr-adium: All good. He also has graphs on OOMMF and Magpar memory consumption in his PhD thesis. We should show these to Weiwei.
2012-09-13 14:54:18 mb8g11: @povray: I'm impressed. @fenics: Told me you had a talk about this.
2012-09-13 14:54:40 mb8g11: Oh, okay, I'll tell Weiwei right now.
2012-09-13 14:55:21 fangohr-adium: Have a look at the nice logo on http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/ . This was part of Richard's PhD on micromagnetics. I think we did this with OOMMF, and the ovf2vtk tool.
2012-09-13 14:56:05 fangohr-adium: Interestingly, the same logo made it to the Enthought Python Distribution Free  (albeit smaller): http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php
2012-09-13 14:56:21 fangohr-adium: Finally, he was part of the Raspberry Pi team ;-)
2012-09-13 14:56:31 fangohr-adium: Anyway, I'll shut up and do some more teaching preparation now.
2012-09-13 14:56:44 fangohr-adium: @talking-to-Weiwei: thanks.
2012-09-13 14:58:12 mb8g11: How very cool!
2012-09-13 14:58:29 mb8g11: We downloaded the thesis, Weiwei is having a look at it now.
2012-09-13 14:58:39 mb8g11: Okay, ttyl.
2012-09-13 15:17:05 fangohr-adium: While we are showing off nice images: Richard also helped me a little in finetuning the povray parameters for the image used as a logo in http://www.cmmp.org.uk/64380
2012-09-13 15:17:52 fangohr-adium: It is a long time ago, but some (then state-of-the-art) visualisations are still available at http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/research/vortex1/mbg/mbg2.html
2012-09-13 15:18:25 fangohr-adium: We used a linux cluster (with 8 500MHz alpha machines) to render the frames for this. A bit like Pixar, only less successful.
2012-09-13 15:18:46 fangohr-adium: I should say for completeness that there is also some interesting science in the motion of these objects; but that's a different story.
2012-09-13 15:19:05 mb8g11: I have no idea what I'm looking at, but the DOOM perspective is awesome.
2012-09-13 15:19:39 fangohr-adium: Ah, yes â€” you mean the camera attached to one of the spheres?
2012-09-13 15:20:00 mb8g11: Yes. Okay, just figured out the marbles are vortices.
2012-09-13 15:20:58 fangohr-adium: So here is your challenge should you wish to accept it: Can you locate a camera on top of a travelling spin wave (maybe moving with the group velocity??) and visualise the motion accordingly? Surely we can something comparable for a magnetic system if we think long enough ...
2012-09-13 15:21:54 mb8g11: Certainly, but what would the camera be looking at?
2012-09-13 15:22:33 mb8g11: Wait. Another spin-wave coming at it. That should be a rough ride.
2012-09-13 15:23:02 fangohr-adium: We could choose the direction perpendicular to the wave front (and within the  film plane) as the direction for the camera to look at. Then look at the magnetisation, and â€” as you just suggest â€” other spin waves, or reflections etc.
2012-09-13 15:24:31 mb8g11: Sounds nice, even if I have no idea how I would even start building an animation like that.
2012-09-13 15:24:58 mb8g11: Nevermind, let's do a feature-length movie out of it.
2012-09-13 15:25:12 fangohr-adium: I have some ideas although it is all a bit whacky at this stage. Let's try to push the science a bit further first; then I am quite happy to discuss.
2012-09-13 15:25:38 fangohr-adium: Agree â€” this will be financially more lucrative than any engineering we can come up. Should get Spielberg involved.
2012-09-13 15:30:49 mb8g11: Spielberg Schmielberg. I want no lesser man that Uwe Boll, hero of the low-budget and direct-to-video productions and the only director alive brave enough to challenge his many critics to a boxing match and indeed beat one of them to a bloody pulp!
2012-09-13 15:31:11 mb8g11: That's the stuff dreams are made of.
2012-09-13 15:31:43 fangohr-adium: Uwe Boll: fine. No boxing for me, please.
2012-09-13 15:31:54 mb8g11: But I agree insofar that some more science can't hurt. I hear it's all the rage.
2012-09-13 15:32:04 fangohr-adium: Bring it on then ;-)
2012-09-13 15:32:20 mb8g11: Working on it!
2012-09-13 17:07:39 fangohr-adium: Over and out for today.
2012-09-13 17:29:59 mb8g11: Bye Hans!
2012-09-14 09:59:41 fangohr-adium: Good Morning.
2012-09-14 10:35:27 mb8g11: Good morning!
2012-09-14 12:07:45 fangohr-adium: What is the lunch situation like - Anybody hungry?
2012-09-14 12:08:52 JustinD: I've already planned to meet a few friends for lunch, sorry
2012-09-14 12:11:30 mb8g11: Yes hungry.
2012-09-14 12:11:50 mb8g11: I'll be with you in a minute.
2012-09-14 12:12:01 fangohr-adium: Okay, sounds good.
2012-09-17 12:18:13 fangohr-adium: Hi all, just so say that I am skipping lunch today.
2012-09-18 09:13:57 fangohr-adium: Mornung Justin.
2012-09-18 09:14:08 JustinD: Good morning Hans
2012-09-18 09:14:11 fangohr-adium: Morning(!) Justin.
2012-09-18 09:15:39 JustinD: I thought you had lapsed into another language for a second
2012-09-18 09:16:02 fangohr-adium: Still have to invent that particular one. ;-)
2012-09-18 09:17:07 JustinD: A language purely for the purpose of confusing people in your office - sounds fun
2012-09-18 09:29:21 fangohr-adium: Ah, yes. Sadly some of my intended English ends up that way already.
2012-09-18 09:34:31 JustinD: Haven't really noticed to be honest
2012-09-18 09:35:23 fangohr-adium: It's probably not that bad. However, I did notice that the odd German word has started to slip into long speeches since I regularly talk German at home with the children. Never mind â€¦
2012-09-18 09:36:01 JustinD: I know the feeling, have been stuck for an English word quite a few times
2012-09-20 09:14:16 fangohr-adium: Morning DokosBot. Just to say that I am busy delivering an intense teaching course today, tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday.
2012-09-20 16:33:24 JustinD: Hans, do you mind if I drop by your office in a minute?
2012-09-20 16:56:51 fangohr-adium: Hi Justin, only saw your message now â€” was coincidence I came past your desk ;-)
2012-09-20 16:57:11 JustinD: Oh, that was lucky then :)
2012-09-20 16:57:54 JustinD: Do you mind if I restrict the benchmark to even numbers of iterations?
2012-09-20 16:58:04 fangohr-adium: No.
2012-09-20 16:58:26 JustinD: Cool, will try and have it running before I leave today then
2012-09-20 16:59:23 fangohr-adium: Fab. Drop me a tar ball with all files, or put them somewhere on a shared dropbox folder. I will try to run them on osiris as well, althought I'd go with your timings (which I also need from you) as you have the GPU card. If you could also add a note on the spec of the GPU and the machine you are using that would be good.
2012-09-20 16:59:47 fangohr-adium: If you do it tomorrow, that would be fine as well, although today would be nice of course.
2012-09-20 17:00:54 JustinD: Well i left for a while to go to the SUSU AGM, so thought I'd stay a bit later today and try and finish this up
2012-09-20 17:01:06 fangohr-adium: Don't let me stop you ;-)
2012-09-20 17:01:20 JustinD: Will do the tarball probably and include a text file or something
2012-09-20 17:01:23 fangohr-adium: (But make sure you leave the building by 11pm.)
2012-09-20 17:01:48 JustinD: Oh, I wasn't planning on being that late, still need to get some food and exercise today :)
2012-09-20 18:06:08 JustinD: I'm actually going to head off now, the code is almost finished, so I'll send it to you in the morning
2012-09-20 18:06:10 JustinD: Bye
2012-09-21 14:24:50 JustinD: @Hans: I've just emailed you the benchmarks
2012-09-21 16:44:16 fangohr-adium: Ta.
2012-09-21 16:44:21 fangohr-adium: Will have a look at them.
2012-09-21 17:05:22 JustinD: No problem, i imagine you'll get similar results on your machine, thought with a bit less of a difference due to the gpu
2012-09-21 17:05:42 fangohr-adium: Very nice.
2012-09-21 17:05:49 fangohr-adium: I am sending some feedback by email.
2012-09-21 17:05:58 JustinD: Thanks
2012-09-21 17:06:04 fangohr-adium: On my machine there is some OpenCL library missing. Let me check the error message ...
2012-09-21 17:07:25 fangohr-adium: Maybe I am just lakcing the right hardware: when trying to run 'python benchmark.py' I get ptxas application ptx input, line â€¦. Instructions * requiers SM1.3 or higher, or map_f64_to_f32. So I guess this fails because my card cannot do any 64 bit operations?
2012-09-21 17:11:57 JustinD: Yes, that's what it sounds like
2012-09-21 17:12:12 JustinD: i did everything in double since that is what python was probably doing
2012-09-21 17:12:31 JustinD: anyway, I unfortunately have an appointment in a few minutes and need to leave
2012-09-21 17:12:48 JustinD: would you like me to just drop by your office if you want me to quickly look?
2012-09-21 17:13:14 fangohr-adium: No, don't worry. I accept we can't run it on osiris; that's fine.
2012-09-21 17:13:18 fangohr-adium: I can use the timings you got.
2012-09-21 17:13:20 JustinD: I've just replied to your email
2012-09-21 17:13:26 JustinD: Ok, great
2012-09-21 17:13:49 JustinD: i can make a 32 bit float version over the weekend if it's useful
2012-09-21 17:14:32 JustinD: Anyway, I have to run off now
2012-09-21 17:14:35 JustinD: have a good weekend
2012-09-21 17:14:43 fangohr-adium: And you ...
2012-09-21 17:14:45 fangohr-adium: Thanks again.
2012-09-21 17:14:48 fangohr-adium: over and out.
2012-09-26 09:53:50 fangohr-adium: Aha, good old DokosBot hanging out here ;)
2012-09-28 07:56:52 mb8g11: Hello DokosBot!
2012-10-01 09:18:19 fangohr-adium: Good Morning DokosBot!
2012-10-01 14:36:17 fangohr-adium: Hi Dmitri, well done ;-)
2012-10-01 14:37:57 D_Chernyshenko: Ok, this seems to be working!
2012-10-02 09:28:22 fangohr-adium: â€¦ and there DokosBot is again â€” phew.
2012-10-02 14:48:12 fangohr-adium: Leaving the office for most of the afternoon.
2012-10-03 09:11:03 fangohr-adium: Good morning Max, DokosBot.
2012-10-03 09:24:12 albert_: Good morning Hans, DokosBot.
2012-10-03 13:47:42 fangohr-adium: Greetings all.
2012-10-03 14:11:01 mb8g11: Hi Hans
2012-10-03 17:11:29 fangohr-adium: Hi all,I am  leaving for the day. Over and out.
2012-10-04 09:13:11 fangohr-adium: Morning Guest17629 â€” who are you? ;)
2012-10-04 11:26:33 Guest17629: Morning Hans, I'm Max. :) For some reason xchat automatically changed my name. No idea why...
2012-10-04 11:27:34 Guest17629: Maybe I should find another client anyway. It seems to behave slightly awkward sometimes...
2012-10-04 11:32:29 albert: Ok, back again as 'albert'... ;-)
2012-10-04 12:13:53 mb8g11: Who is up for lunch?
2012-10-04 12:15:27 Guest20581: Me!
2012-10-04 12:27:31 mb8g11: Who are you anyways.
2012-10-04 12:27:54 Guest20581: Dammit, nickname changed automatically by xchat again. Just a second...
2012-10-04 12:28:20 albert: Ok, here we go again: Me!
2012-10-04 12:28:34 D_Chernyshenko: I'm going to eat a bit later I think...
2012-10-04 12:28:56 D_Chernyshenko: albert is now known as Guest13127
2012-10-04 12:29:32 Guest13127: WTF?!?!
2012-10-04 12:29:42 Guest13127: I got the warning: "You failed to identify in time for the nickname Albert"
2012-10-04 12:29:52 Guest13127: ... but no option to identify? Weird...
2012-10-04 12:30:02 D_Chernyshenko: You probably have a password for your nickname
2012-10-04 12:30:18 D_Chernyshenko: You need to identify with a command /msg nickserv identify your_password
2012-10-04 12:30:38 Guest13127: Hmmm.... It used to work a while ago without password. Also, if I have a password I certainly don't remember it... ;-)
2012-10-04 12:30:57 Guest13127: Also, which server is "nicksrv" anyway? Where would I have registered?
2012-10-04 12:31:14 fangohr-adium: Marc-Antonio is the expert on IRC.
2012-10-04 12:31:39 mb8g11: We'll sort this out.
2012-10-04 12:48:48 fangohr-adium1: Hi all, we are going for lunch in the staff club around 13:30 with Anil Prabhakher and Arti Kashup if you are interested to join.
2012-10-04 12:49:04 fangohr-adium1: (not sure the message came through before)
2012-10-04 12:50:11 mb8g11: Max and I'll join you then.
2012-10-04 12:56:40 fangohr-adium1: Nice. I'll drop a note here when we are about to go.
2012-10-04 13:35:37 fangohr-adium1: Hi Max, Marc-Antonio, we are ready to go â€” do you want to come by my office?
2012-10-04 13:35:56 mb8g11: On our way.
2012-10-04 13:35:57 albert_: Sure, we'll be there in a minute!
2012-10-04 13:36:52 fangohr-adium1: if we are gone, just follow to staff club.
2012-10-04 15:29:45 mb8g11: Hans, is now still good for you?
2012-10-05 09:22:13 fangohr-adium1: Good morning, team.
2012-10-05 09:56:53 mb8g11: Good morning, Hans!
2012-10-05 10:28:08 fangohr-adium1: Morning all.
2012-10-05 12:40:01 fangohr-adium1: [Hi all, no time for lunch today for me.]
2012-10-05 16:58:45 fangohr-adium1: Hi all, excellent discussion on tidying up the code regarding tests and C++ [just starting to catch up with email].
2012-10-05 17:03:20 mb8g11: It'll only get more difficult to clean up as time progresses and the code-base grows.
2012-10-05 17:11:18 fangohr-adium1: Yes, I agree. I very much like your plans and iniative.
2012-10-05 17:19:49 fangohr-adium1: Need to leave for today. Over and out, Hans
2012-10-05 17:20:58 mb8g11: Have a nice week-end, bye!
2012-10-05 19:08:16 mb8g11: Heya Marijan
2012-10-05 19:08:23 mb8g11: What are you up to?
2012-10-05 19:08:35 marijan: heya
2012-10-05 19:38:55 fangohr: Hi MA, still there?
2012-10-05 19:38:59 mb8g11: Hiya
2012-10-05 19:39:42 fangohr: Question for marvinhg: I have forgotten how bitbucket works, but presumably I either need an email address or marvin (which we don't have?), or a bitbucket account for marvinhg which I can allow to write to finmag?
2012-10-05 19:41:08 mb8g11: In the finmag repository on the bitbucket website, in the Admin tab, Access management menu item.
2012-10-05 19:41:32 mb8g11: The username you want to add is marvinhg, who I have registered earlier this evening.
2012-10-05 19:47:11 fangohr: Very good, done that.
2012-10-05 22:17:41 mb8g11: test
