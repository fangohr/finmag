fangohr: Still testing ...
2012-02-12 21:32:46 fangohr: And more testing.
2012-02-12 21:33:40 fangohr: Working on logging this session automatically.
2012-02-12 21:42:44 fangohr: If all goes well, then this note will be auto-committed tonight to the mercurial repository.
2012-02-13 09:19:35 HansFangohr: Morning everybody.
2012-02-13 11:24:25 ww1g11: Hello, this is Weiwei.
2012-02-13 11:24:52 HansFangohr: Yuuhouu, well done Weiwei :)
2012-02-13 12:06:41 HansFangohr: Anybody up for lunch? When? 12:30? 13:00?
2012-02-13 12:46:53 mb8g11: 13:00 is good.
2012-02-13 12:54:14 HansFangohr: Okay, let's make it so.
2012-02-13 12:54:55 andersej: I'll join!
2012-02-13 16:31:45 mb8g11: How can I make sure if I work on a matrix or a vector?
2012-02-13 17:14:43 HansFangohr: If I understand the question correctly, and this is about numpy.arrays, you can use the 'shape' attribute of an array to distingish them.
2012-02-14 09:44:31 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-02-14 09:46:43 HansFangohr: Good morning, Sir :)
2012-02-14 09:54:58 HansFangohr: Hi Anders, I played a little with your code, and added a comment to the story in pivotal -- not sure whether you get email notification for this?
2012-02-14 09:56:31 HansFangohr: Marc-Antonio (mb8g11), as you rightly say, we should make the 'stories' as small as possible. I have thus accepted the 'exchange' story as completed, and added two new ones, each suggesting a test for the exchange interaction. Feel free to add more as you go along.
2012-02-14 09:56:49 HansFangohr: I am busy all morning with Interviews of new PhD students; I hope to have some time in the early afternoon.
2012-02-14 10:00:25 andersej: Yes, I got the notification. Will take a closer look at it. If it is zero initially, it will always be zero in this simple case. Perhaps it changes if there are other contributions to the equation.
2012-02-14 11:44:19 GabrielB: Hi everyone can anyone advise me with mercurial? I have added a "documentation" subdirectory to /demag and am not quite sure how to get HG to see it and push it up into Bitbucket.
2012-02-14 11:52:46 andersej: Think it is just hg add file, hg commit -m 'Message of what is changed', and then hg push.
2012-02-14 11:53:26 andersej: Where file of course is the name of the file you want to add.
2012-02-14 11:58:29 mb8g11: Are there files in that directory?
2012-02-14 12:39:52 andersej: Anyone up for lunch sometime between now and 1?
2012-02-14 12:42:19 mb8g11: 13:00 is good.
2012-02-14 12:51:55 GabrielB: thanks Anders! I will try with -m instead of the normal commit.
2012-02-14 12:52:51 GabrielB: I have just spoken to Anders Logg, he  recommended Nitsche's method in order to get the demag field.
2012-02-14 13:49:50 HansFangohr: Hi Gabriel, that's great. What is Nitsche's method ? ;-) Do you have a reference for it? I haven't heard of the name yet.
2012-02-14 13:54:50 mb8g11:  1ffd48ebd533b81339e58e1f185c32a8ebeedce8
2012-02-14 13:55:01 mb8g11: J.A. Nitsche, Uber ein Variationsprinzip zur Loesung von Dirichlet-Problemen bei Verwendung von Teilraeumen, die keinen Randbedingungen unterworfen sind, Abhandlungen aus
2012-02-14 13:55:04 mb8g11: dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universitaet Hamburg 36 (1970/71), 9â€“15. MR0341903(49:6649)
2012-02-14 13:55:17 mb8g11: disregard the first message, that was a paste gone wrong
2012-02-14 13:58:32 mb8g11: @GabrielB it is not possible to represent an empty directory in Mercurial. As soon as you put a file in it though, you can simply commit the file and the repository will get added as well.
2012-02-14 13:58:46 mb8g11: *and the directory
2012-02-14 14:00:09 GabrielB: When I commited I think my file was stored locally and not as part of the project attached to the Bitbucket depo.
2012-02-14 14:02:37 GabrielB: my folder "documentation" does not show up in the source when I look at it in bitbucket
2012-02-14 14:03:57 mb8g11: Let's say you have the file doc.tex in there.
2012-02-14 14:04:07 mb8g11: hg add documentation/doc.tex
2012-02-14 14:04:17 mb8g11: hg ci (or hg ci documentation/doc.tex)
2012-02-14 14:04:30 mb8g11: hg push
2012-02-14 14:06:38 GabrielB: thanks this is what i get
2012-02-14 14:06:40 GabrielB: gaba@ubuntu:~/devmag/finmag/devtests/demag/documentation$ hg add truncdemag1.tex
2012-02-14 14:06:40 GabrielB: truncdemag1.tex already tracked!
2012-02-14 14:06:41 GabrielB: gaba@ubuntu:~/devmag/finmag/devtests/demag/documentation$ hg ci
2012-02-14 14:06:41 GabrielB: nothing changed
2012-02-14 14:06:41 GabrielB: gaba@ubuntu:~/devmag/finmag/devtests/demag/documentation$ hg push
2012-02-14 14:06:41 GabrielB: pushing to default-push
2012-02-14 14:06:43 GabrielB: abort: repository default-push not found!
2012-02-14 14:08:37 GabrielB: This description of the method is the closest to what was shown to me by Anders.
2012-02-14 14:08:38 GabrielB: www.ann.jussieu.fr/2007/PDFSeminaires/RolfStenberg071207.pdf
2012-02-14 14:08:57 GabrielB: If it works I will include it in the Docu of course :-)
2012-02-14 14:10:51 mb8g11: In the repository root, open the file .hg/hgrc. You want it to look like that http://www.pastebucket.com/1484
2012-02-14 14:11:09 mb8g11: I assumed you use https and not ssh.
2012-02-14 14:20:15 mb8g11: If all fails, check out a new copy of the repo and copy the files by hand. And while you're at it, set up SSH, there is a nice guide in the bitbucket documentation.
2012-02-14 14:20:31 mb8g11: That way, you won't have to enter your password when pushing.
2012-02-14 14:28:52 GabrielB: ok the repository root already has the pastebucket code. I am guessing I shouldnt try adding it to .hg/hgrc in the new directory
2012-02-14 14:29:10 mb8g11: Correct.
2012-02-14 14:31:05 mb8g11: Try hg push https://gabrielb@bitbucket.org/fangohr/finmag
2012-02-14 14:55:54 GabrielB: implemented a 1-d Nitsche method. The results seem to look similar to that obtained by Fredkin- Koehler.
2012-02-14 14:57:55 GabrielB: the results can be seem in nitschetest.py
2012-02-14 14:59:07 GabrielB: I moved the documentation out of the new folder for now thanks for the help so far mb8g11 (Mark I guess!), I will keep trying later to get the new folder in place and clean up a bit
2012-02-14 14:59:49 Marc-Antonio: Yes, Marc
2012-02-14 15:04:52 GabrielB: lol I am off to pick up my daughter! see everyone tomorrow
2012-02-14 15:18:21 andersej: @Marc-Antonio, can you take a look at my program when you have time?
2012-02-14 15:20:58 Marc-Antonio: 16:00?
2012-02-14 15:21:10 andersej: Great
2012-02-14 15:30:12 HansFangohr: Hi all, what is a good IRC client for Linux (Ubuntu)?
2012-02-14 15:31:51 andersej: I'm happy with xchat now.
2012-02-15 08:54:57 HansFangohr: Morning Anders.
2012-02-15 08:56:00 andersej: Good morning! Just read your email, I'll have it done by the end of the day.
2012-02-15 08:58:21 HansFangohr: No rush -- it may just be fun to do this :) I also had another idea for a good test, and will add this to the tracker in a moment.
2012-02-15 09:01:26 HansFangohr: This is the extra test for the Jacobian: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/24971625
2012-02-15 09:04:33 HansFangohr: Anders, I added a story for the test I suggested in the email: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/24971705
2012-02-15 09:06:26 andersej: Okay, i thought you combined it in the first one. Sorry. I don't mean to steal all stories.
2012-02-15 09:16:32 HansFangohr: You steal as many as you like :)
2012-02-15 09:40:22 HansFangohr: Hi Gabriel.
2012-02-15 09:40:45 HansFangohr: Andersej, just to add; I think the reason I didn't see those stories started is that you didn't click on 'save' yet or so -- It is all here now.
2012-02-15 11:19:47 andersej: HansFangohr, do you have time today to explain the two time scales scheme a bit more detailed than in the story description?
2012-02-15 11:48:56 HansFangohr: Not at the moment (but later this afternoon). You don't need to worry about it: Use an exchange interaction strength that is realistic (ask MA, or the Nmag Manual) and an applied field that has the strength of 1 Tesla (that is very roughly 1e6 A/m, the same magnitude as the saturation magnetisation), and you should have the two timescales. I think Marc-Antonio maybe able to explain as well.
2012-02-15 14:36:00 HansFangohr: Andersej, are you okay to come to my office to talk through your code?
2012-02-15 14:36:46 andersej: Yes, I'm there in two minutes. Will just push what I'm doing.
2012-02-15 14:37:47 HansFangohr: Okay, great.
2012-02-15 14:50:25 mb8g11: Hans, I'm afraid that the loading of the C-code works perfectly fine on my machine.
2012-02-15 15:08:22 HansFangohr: Marc-Antonio, I have created an account for you on the machine. It is called 'osiris.sesnet.soton.ac.uk'.
2012-02-15 15:10:00 mb8g11: (by the way, the volume is a vector)
2012-02-16 09:28:37 HansFangohr: Greetings, DokosBot.
2012-02-16 10:31:42 HansFangohr: Hi Andersej, mb8g11, any plans for lunch? If so, what is your preferred time?
2012-02-16 10:32:22 andersej: 12:30?
2012-02-16 10:37:00 HansFangohr: Okay, fine. Dmitri and I have a meeting at 11;00 in physics. We'll come back to the office before lunch then -- probably takes only 30 or 45 minutes.
2012-02-16 10:56:59 mb8g11: Oki.
2012-02-17 09:23:07 HansFangohr: Morning Anders and DokosBot.
2012-02-17 09:23:40 andersej: Good morning, Hans!
2012-02-17 13:18:15 andersej: Which PETSc version are you using? I'm on 3.2-p5 and I get PETSc error when I try to run /examples/exchange_1D/run_visual.py. It is caused by the last line of the first for loop (line 52).
2012-02-20 08:55:38 HansFangohr: Morning DokosBot.
2012-02-20 09:11:44 mb8g11: Good morning!
2012-02-20 09:12:23 HansFangohr: Good Morning. I am just moving the (very handy) DokosBot from eta to summer.kk - a good opportunity to document this here.
2012-02-20 09:28:57 mb8g11: So is summer the newly installed machine?
2012-02-20 09:29:31 HansFangohr: Yes; the machine was around before but I had to upgrade the OS somewhat severly (done now).
2012-02-20 09:34:52 HansFangohr: Hello DokosBot. You have just joined automatically (via a cronjob) because summer.kk rebooted. You are started via fangohr's cronjob, and another cronjob on the same machine will commit all the changes to finmag/logbooks/finmag-irc.log every night at 23:59. Just so we have this recorded.
2012-02-20 10:54:09 mb8g11: Do you know how to disable the demag-field in nmag or point me to the documentation? Can't find how to do so.
2012-02-20 10:54:47 fangohr: Yes, when you create a simulation object, there should be an option like 'demag=False' or so.
2012-02-20 10:55:39 fangohr: Actually, it is 'do_demag=False'. See http://nmag.soton.ac.uk/nmag/0.2/manual/html/command_reference.html#simulation
2012-02-20 10:57:37 mb8g11: thank you!
2012-02-20 14:38:45 GabrielB: 2-d and 3-d demag problems implemented! Tests for solver coming soon.
2012-02-20 15:15:50 HansFangohr: Hi Gabriel, great. I'll try to have a look at this soon.
2012-02-21 08:46:18 andersej: Good morning, Hans and DokosBot!
2012-02-21 09:06:18 HansFangohr: Good Morning Anders and DokosBot.
2012-02-21 09:09:47 HansFangohr: Anders, shall we get together in 20 minutes or so to go through Marie's reply?2012-02-21 09:50:49 andersej: Again I don't get notifications when I get a message... Sorry. But is it okay now? I can come to your office.
2012-02-21 12:03:13 HansFangohr: Hi Anders, am on the phone right now. Lunch in 20 minutes or so?
2012-02-21 12:20:24 andersej: Yes.
2012-02-21 12:27:36 HansFangohr: Fab, I'll come over now.
2012-02-22 08:44:18 HansFangohr: Morning Anders, DokosBot.
2012-02-22 09:03:23 HansFangohr: Hi Gabriel, good to see you.
2012-02-22 09:03:43 HansFangohr: Are you okay to delay our meeting today to 15:30 UK time? Not sure whether you have seen my email already.
2012-02-22 09:04:27 GabrielB: Hi hans I'll read the mail
2012-02-22 09:06:31 GabrielB: Ahh ok Doctoral training centre meeting alles klar. 15: 30 might be pushing it a little do you have any time this morning?
2012-02-22 09:07:39 GabrielB: Ahh I mean it might be bit late and the it would be nicer to meet in the morning with less time pressure :-)
2012-02-22 09:07:40 HansFangohr: No, teaching. How about tomorrow 10am?
2012-02-22 09:07:51 HansFangohr: Yes, I agree ;-)
2012-02-22 09:08:25 HansFangohr: By what time do you need to leave? Maybe we can start today, and continue tomorrow?
2012-02-22 09:08:47 GabrielB: ok sounds good! Just to give you a quick update the Nitsche Solver passes all the tests so far now that the boundary values of phitot have been fixed.
2012-02-22 09:09:18 GabrielB: So for tomorrow I will try to compare to the analytic solution and of course write up a summary of the nitsche method
2012-02-22 09:09:24 HansFangohr: That sounds great. Also in 3d? ;-)
2012-02-22 09:09:27 GabrielB: yes
2012-02-22 09:09:34 GabrielB: 1 to 3 d :-)
2012-02-22 09:09:49 HansFangohr: Fabulous.
2012-02-22 09:10:58 HansFangohr: If you choose M=[1,0,0], you should fine that phi is a linear function of x inside the sphere. In particular, if you compute the negative gradient of phi, you should get a vector field that is [-1/3,0,0] inside the sphere. I guess this is the analytic solution you refer to, and would be nice to see.
2012-02-22 09:32:30 andersej: Sorry, didn't get notified as usual.. Morning! How come you have two users always logged on, Hans?
2012-02-22 10:59:18 HansFangohr: Anders, these are from machines that are never switched off.
2012-02-22 11:45:02 HansFangohr: Anders, Marc-Antonio, just to say that I am not having lunch today.
