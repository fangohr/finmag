The two files in this directory illustrate my template for a simple
simulation setup with Sumatra (whenever I need to set up a new
simulation that uses Sumatra I essentially just copy and paste them
and then adapt them accordingly). Maybe this is helpful to others,
which is why I'm committing them here. Note that there is a lot of
freedom in how to use Sumatra, so your mileage my vary. For example,
I like to store all the output from each simulation run in a separate
subdirectory of the Data/ directory (which is why I cd into that
directory after reading the parameters), but your needs may be
different.

Once I have tweaked these two files to my needs, I run the following
two commands to initialise the Sumatra repository and configure it.

    smt init MyProjectName
    smt configure --addlabel=parameters -e python -m main.py --labelgenerator=timestamp --timestamp_format "%Y-%m-%d__%H_%M_%S"

Again, you may want to use different options, but this is what I
have found useful for my workflow. Make sure that the filename
given after the -m argument matches the name of your main simulation
script (the one that should be invoked by Sumatra during each run).

Once this is done, you can run simulations like this:

   smt run -r "A short message describing this particular run" defaults.param [[PARAM=value] ...]
