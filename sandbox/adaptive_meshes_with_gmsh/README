This is an exploration of gmesh's capabilities of producing meshes
with varying element sizes. For example, we can produce a cylindrical
mesh where the element size is small in the center and large near the
boundaries, which is useful for the simulation of vortex structures.

Type 'make mesh' in this directory to generate the mesh and have it
displayed by dolfin.
