* Are we ready to move to Python 3 <2014-05-23 Fri>

Hi Hans,

My biggest concern are other libraries, such as scipy, py4petsc, etc, which may not be ready for python 3.

That was my first thought as well, so I googled it and was surprised to see that numpy and scipy do support Python 3:

   http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/faq.html#do-numpy-and-scipy-support-python-3-x

I don't know about petsc4py, but a quick look at the source seems to suggest that it's essentially written in Cython, so maybe that's not a concern either? The PyPI page [1] also has the categories "Python 2" and "Python 3", so perhaps it would just work with Python 3, too.

Regarding our code base, the link that Jan Blechta sent around may be helpful:

(Although I haven't read it yet.)

Cheers,
Max
